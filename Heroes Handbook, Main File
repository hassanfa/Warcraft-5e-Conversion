## Foreword </div>
I've made this book in an attempt to bring the beloved Warcraft franchise into the 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons. It is a task that has taken me months to do, and many more to come I am sure as I continue to work on this in my spare time.

My intention with this book have been from the start to make it as a free resource for all to use, and never to be bought or paid for, I do this because I want others to enjoy it, not because I want to earn money from it.

This books is made to compliment 5th Edition **Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide**, and **Monster Manual**. Using the rules presented in those and balanced around being playable in a standard D&D setting without requiring modifications.

All changes made in a new version of the handbook can be found by checking the link below. I've also provided a link to the races balancing document, in case someone likes numbers like me, Enjoy!

# Chapter 1: Races
Armies and factions have always defined the Warcraft world, and two of the most powerful factions on Azeroth today are the Alliance and Horde. Most players belong to one or the other faction, although anomalies do exist.

## Choosing a Side
At character creation, every player must choose their character’s faction. It is as much a part of the hero as their class or background. All characters in a party are usually of the same faction.

Although every race has an affiliation, there are excep-tions. Creating a character outside their normal affiliation is challenging, but offers a great role play opportunities for the player. Some suggestions are listed below.

 - The character was born into the faction.
 - The character was saved or befriended by members of the faction.
 - The character fled from their faction.
 - The character witnessed members of their faction doing something they found reprehensible.

## The Alliance
The Alliance have proven themselves to be fierce combatants, often giving their lives when called for. The faction is not a uniform governmental body, but is a coalition of mutual military and economic aid. Diplomacy is key with in the Alliance and decisions are traditionally made by being voted on by the Alliance's most influential members. Stormwind is described as the most powerful force in the now multiracial Alliance. With it becoming the de facto leader of the remaining human kingdoms and entering a powerful alliance with the strongest dwarven kingdom, Ironforge, Stormwind has thus been shown to be the most influential kingdom and therefore the de facto driving force of Alliance politics. Therefore, Stormwind is undisputedly looked to for maintaining the Alliance and its policies. Stormwind is where the main superpowers of the Alliance conference to discuss world issues and mutual defense. The majority of Alliance citizens also recognizes Stormwind City as the heart of the Alliance. The High King coordinates the workings of the Alliance's armies in order to safeguard the Alliance's interests and defense. 

Even now, as always, humans are the glue that hold the Alliance together, being the most numerous and diplomatic of the member races. The armies of Stormwind are primarily stationed in the southern Eastern Kingdoms, securing regions such as Elwynn Forest, Duskwood, Westfall, and the Redridge mountains.

## The Horde 
The Horde makes no compromises <br> when it comes to excellence, and the <br> power and ferocity of their warriors is <br> legendary. Misunderstood by many as <br> evil, the Horde possesses a strong code of <br> honor and strict laws for disobedience. <br> All members of the Horde have to swear a blood oath to join the faction and are thus obligated to follow the warchief's commands and support the warchief in war if the warchief calls upon them for aid. The position of warchief can be attained by having the previous warchief choose a successor or challenging the current warchief to a Mak'gora: a prearranged duel with deadly weapons between two people following a formal procedure in the presence of witnesses and traditionally fought until one party yields or is killed, usually to settle a quarrel involving a point of honor. Above all else, the title warchief is granted to those who display strength and decisive action.

The warchief may accept ambassadors and advisors from all the different tribes and members of the Horde to makes sure their voice is heard in the running of the fledgling hegemony but ultimately, only the warchief may have the final say in matters concerning the entire Horde. Each race within the Horde choose a single leader to govern their people and their people's kingdoms and also to represent their people in the high Horde echelon.

Despite their somewhat monstrous appearance, the majority of the Horde is not evil, much like the Alliance, it is comprised of diverse factions and individuals who possess a wide range of values and virtues. Even so, there is one expectation that must be met when joining the Horde: regardless of gender or station, all are expected to pull their own weight and give their talents for the betterment of the Horde. When weakness is a liability to the <br> of the Horde, it is the duty of the strong to <br> usurp control from the incompetent <br> and redeem the Horde. *Lok'tar ogar! <br> Victory or death* - These words bind <br> one to the Horde. For they are the <br> most sacred and fundamental of <br> truths to any warrior of the <br> Horde, for the Horde, failure <br> is not an option.

Culturally, orcs and tauren <br> believe in redemption more <br> than most other races on <br> Azeroth and are willing to <br> give almost anyone a chance, <br> regardless of reputation. The trolls <br> seem to have even accepted, (if not <br> at least tolerate) their ancient enemy <br> the blood elves. Largely because of <br> these beliefs, a number of mortal races <br> and many diverse factions can be found <br> in bservice to the Horde.

## Choosing a Race
A *visit to one of the great cities in the world of Azeroth Stormwind City, the Capital City of Stormwind, the City of Doors overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless dialects of different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants.*

*And the people themselves represent many different races, from gnomes and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful elves, mingling among a variety of humans.*

*Scattered among the common races: a draenei here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly worgen there, lurking in the shadows. Night elves and dwarves live and work alongside humans. And there, a lone pandaren — a wanderer from the shifting isles of the ever expanding great sea, trying to make his way in a world unknown.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— A poetic gnome* &nbsp;</div>

Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. The ones presented in this book are the races most well known to become adventurers and heroes, spread throughout every corner of Azeroth's continents.

Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character's adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a gnome could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic.

Your character race not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character's story. Each race's description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies.
<br>
These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their race. It's worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character's background and personality.

\columnbreak

### Racial Traits
The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.

#### Ability Score Increase
Every race increases one or more of a character's
ability scores.

#### Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race's expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game.

#### Alignment
Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.

#### Size
Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons.

#### Speed
Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling and fighting.

#### Languages
By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Each race has their own language, with multiple  dialects. as well as a 'common' language, that the majority of their faction speaks and understands. Chapter 4 lists languages commonly spoken on Azeroth.

#### Subraces
Many races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among the subraces vary significantly from race to race.

## Human
*No one feels he deserves it. Because no one does. It is grace, pure and simple. We are inherently unworthy, simply because we are human, and all human beings—aye, the elves, dwarves, and all the other races—are flawed. But the Light loves us anyway. It loves us for what we sometimes can rise to in rare moments. It loves us for what we can do to help others.*
<div style="text-align:Right">

*— Uther the Lightbringer* &nbsp;</div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

Humans, collectively referred to as *humanity*, are a resilient species native to Azeroth. Their short lives, compared to elves and dwarves, pushes them to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Their valor, optimism, and stubbornness have led them to build some of the greatest kingdoms on Azeroth, some of which still stand thousands of years later. Their continued ability to adapt and rebuild has made them a vital force in an ever-changing world.

### A Broad Spectrum
With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are unparalleled in their physical diversity. There is no typical human. On average, they stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Their skin ranges from near black to very pale, with hair in shades black, blond, and red, and males sporting sparse or thick facial hair. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and can sometimes live to a century.

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:542px'></div>

### Variety in All Things
Humans are among the most adaptable and ambitious people on Azeroth. Their tastes vary and customs vary widely, as do their morals, across their numerous kingdoms. Though when they first do settle, they stay: building cities to last the ages. An individual human's life span might be comparatible short, but the nations and the culture of humanity preserves traditions reaching back thousands of years. They live fully in the present but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy.

### Proudly Standing
Despite what atrocities have happened to them, humans remain hardy and brave, thoroughly committed to building strong societies, reinforcing their kingdoms, and reclaiming lost nations. Years of war have tempered their resolve, and they are more determined than ever before. Their value of virtue, honor and courage shine their ranks.

### Faithful
Among all human nations, the holy light is a central part of civilized society. By most it is considered the only religion and a staple of worship, respect, and honor. The religion is widely worshiped throughout Azeroth, yet humans were the first to utilize its powers in an offensive manner with the creation of paladins. Throughout their kingdoms, churches of the holy light can be found, an organization dedicated to creating a world of honor, and justice.

### Affiliation
Humans began the Alliance and it could not exist without them. Humans and orcs joined forces to face the Burning Legion years ago, but old habits returned once they dispatched the demon threat. Although the Alliance and Horde leaders bear a healthy respect for each another, old racial hatreds still stir within the hearts of their troops. 

They respect the races of their alliance, and carries no ill wish against any of them. They know they are the center stone of the alliance, and that a good relationship is key.

### Human Names and Ethnicities
Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarven or Darnassian, but most parents give names that are linked to their region's culture or to the naming traditions of their ancestors.

The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region. For example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in the peninsula of Gilneas than in the southern kingdom of Stormwind. Human physical characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Eastern Kingdoms have every possible variation of coloration and features.

Seven human kingdoms and ethnic groups are widely recognized. These groups, and the typical names of their members, can be used as inspiration no matter which kingdom your human is in.

## Dwarf
*Dwarves are short and stout creatures mostly inhabiting Khaz Modan in the Eastern Kingdoms. They are shorter than humans but taller than gnomes, taking advantage of their size when possible and relying on their robustness and strength when not.*

*The average dwarf is steady, observant and composed both during work and combat, yet able to rage with fierce zeal and persistence when the situation calls for it. While a dwarf prefers to plan forward to overcome challenges, many of them easily lose their temperament and self-restraint when exposed to conditions stirring their feelings and concerns.*

### Introduction
Dwarves are a proud, stern and determined people with streaks of kindness hidden under the gruff exteriors of their sturdy frames. Their love for battle, invention and exploration impels them ever forward to discover and unearth the mysteries of their heritage, educating them further about those who first created the dwarven race.

Only recently have the dwarves discovered the legacy of their ancient progenitors, the Titans. As the dwarves begin to delve deeper into the mysteries of their past, they also begin to uncover deeper enigmas. 

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:515px'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, they keep to the forges and workshops, ever inno-vating and creating new and more effective ways to destroy. Steam powered technology and firearms originate from dwarven inventiveness and creativity. The stout race is renowned for its skills at battle and also as cunning engineers and crafters. 

### Exploratious
The uncovered fragments of their distant past have led the dwarves on an unprecedented exodus of exploration.

Seeking out their origins, the dwarves have dispatched prospectors across all of Lordaeron in order to seek out signs of the Titans, the supposed creators of the dwarves. The dwarves have embraced the idea that it is their purpose to search the world for more signs of proof of their heritage. Dwarven outposts exist in the most desolate of places on Azeroth. 

Here, the dwarves spend their time seeking out the secrets of ancient times, or simply use their outposts as staging grounds for expeditions to clear out their enemies so that they may continue their quest.

### Rough Exterior
Dwarves are stout and powerful, with short muscular bodies. Male dwarves tend to have long hair, and beards or facial hair often tied in ornate braids. Female dwarves also have sturdy muscular frames, but they are buxom and lack facial hair, despite the claims of some of the less educated sages of other races. The average dwarf stands between 4 feet and 5 feet in height and weighs between 140 to 160 pounds.

### Affiliation 
Dwarves are part of the alliance. While the dwarves of Khaz Modan appreciate the fighting skill of the Horde, it is with grim eyes that they look upon the orcs and their allies, the trolls and the Forsaken. Although the dwarves have held dealings of commerce and diplomacy with the blood elves, they keep the people of Quel’Thalas at an arm’s distance. While the darnassian elves may share the same allegiances, the dwarves look upon them with suspicion and some trepidation.

Humans, however, are the staunch and constant allies of the dwarven people and find welcome, favor and kindness when in dwarven lands.

### Names
Dwarves typically have names reflecting the sturdy nature of their past. Many also have surnames that were earned by a member of the family in service during a quest or in a particular moment of notoriety or infamy that has now become part of a family legacy.

<div style='margin-top:-18px;'></div>

<br>**Male Names:** Barab, Aradun, Thorin, Magni, Garrim, 

Wendel, Thurimar, Irmirn, Bhaduk, Gengur
<br>**Female Names:** Chise, Helge, Ferya, Furga, Krona, Imli, 

Gwamde, Illia, Somdunn, Thanmu, Eniss, Nanla

Hammergrim, Chunderstout, Broadmail, Madpride

## Night Elf
*Darkness covered us in the beginning, and we could not see. We cried for guidance and the moon shone down bright upon us. Her soft light not only illuminated the night for us but also gave comfort.
Her light touched us from within, enabling us to see even when the moon was not visible...*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Tyrande Whisperwind* &nbsp;</div>

### Introduction
The night elves are the direct descendants of dark trolls. This peace loving and fiercely independent tribe took up residence at the Well of Eternity. The magic contained within elevated their forms to match their graceful spirits, completely transforming them into highly intelligent and near immortal beings, forever changing them into the night elves known today.

The reclusive Night Elves were the first race to awaken in the world of Azeroth. These shadowy, ancient beings were the first to study magic and let it loose throughout the world nearly ten thousand years before the First War. The Night Elves' reckless use of magic drew the Burning Legion into the world and led to a catastrophic war between the two titanic races. The Night Elves barely managed to banish the Legion from the world, but their beautiful homeland was shattered and drowned by the sea.

### Graceful Creatures
The night elves are imposing in stature, males being on average 7 feet tall. Male kaldorei are very muscular, with broad chests and shoulders, indicative of the strength that lies within both their minds and bodies. Female night elves have that same strength lying in their minds and bodies; they are stunningly beautiful, lithe and curvaceous, yet extremely muscular and strong. 

The race’s prominent eyebrows, long pointed ears and natural aspects imply a feral grace. 

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:500px'></div>

Skin tones range from pale white to blue to violet or even ruddy red, and hair in colors from bright white to woodland green to lustrous black.

Many night elves wear markings of some meaning on their faces. The tattooing marks, mark an earlier rite of passage. Most commonly the markings symbolize an animal totem, or others indicative perhaps of the Wild, of the Grove, or of the Fang, thus recognizing that night elven society is indeed deeply druidic and spiritual and that even before druids these animalistic and spiritual beliefs existed, and that gender is irrelevant in the case of worship and that truly they are an equal society.

### A Timeless Perspective
Night Elves can live to become thousands of years old, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.

Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.

### Affiliation
The night elves are members of the Alliance, but they are not the most trusted or highest regarded members of this group of races. Although honorable and just, the elves’ natural distrust has tainted their relations somewhat. Combined with their mystical appearances and mysterious natures, interactions with other races become uncomfortable at times. There is a strong streak of isolationism in the Kaldorei, for they are uncomfortable leaving the verdant mists of Teldrassil.

Still, the night elves’ leaders see wisdom in an alliance with the younger races. The younger races show potential, and because of this the night elves see themselves as observers, waiting to step in to correct any dangerous mistakes. 

Their hatred of orcs has also fueled their participation in the Alliance. After the death of Cenarius during the Third War, many sentinels, druids and warrior night elves began a great hunt. Some night elves happily hunt orcs as a repayment for Cenarius’ murder.

### Names
Night Elven names always have a special meaning. First names derive from an elven word or the name of a famous hero having a totemic or ancestral connection. Surnames are indicative of the family line and sometimes date back thousands of years.

## Gnome
*The clever, spunky, and oftentimes eccentric gnomes present a unique paradox among the civilized races of Azeroth. Brilliant inventors with an irrepressibly cheerful disposition, this race has suffered treachery, displacement, and near-genocide. It is their remarkable optimism in the face of such calamity that symbolizes the truly unshakable spirit of the gnomes.*

### Introduction
Gnomes are a diminutive, wiry race of tinkers who live underground. In the Second War, they built vehicles and gadgets for the Alliance, submarines and flying machines, to combat the Horde. They are great mechanics and inventors, and are renowned for their knowledge and eccentric natures. The gnomes had a city, Gnomeregan, built into Ironforge Mountain. But invading troggs destroyed it and slaughtered its citizens.

Many survivors moved into Khaz Modan and now live with the Dun Morogh dwarves, and a few traveled with their dwarven friends to Kalimdor. 

The gnomes are still reeling from the destruction of their home city and are loath to leave the safety of the dwarven tunnels. Most gnomes on Kalimdor remain secluded in Bael Modan.

### Cheerful Expression
Even after the decimation of their race and the destruction of their city, gnomes are an amiable and kind hearted lot. They make and keep friends easily; others find disliking a gnome to be difficult.

A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. 

<br>  
<div style='margin-top:835px'></div>

Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome's insatiable interest in everything around.

A gnome's personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome's beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome's clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.

\pagebreakNum

### Exceptional Tinker
Gnomes tend to design complicated devices that are relatively safe. Gnomes are in many ways commensurate organizers: a gnome can spend as much time organizing and planning a project as they do actually working on it. If the design fails, they try to learn why, and fix it if they can. 

If they meet with success, they will continue to tinker with it and improve the design, often for years afterward. Thus, many gnomish designs feature a high degree of complexity and a low chance of failure, the exceptions being those that dabble with chaos energy — but even then, they take steps to ensure the worst that could happen is a brief, non-fatal failure.

While a goblin would scream and flee at the mere thought of a cost overrun, a gnome simply shrugs and presses on. If a project fails to work correctly the first time, a gnome will continue to tinker with it, while a goblin would usually give up and move to something else. Thus, gnomish items have very low failure rates compared to goblin items.

### Affiliation
Gnomes are members of the alliance, they are great friends of the dwarves and have fought and died alongside human soldiers. They are wary of the blood elves, but so is everyone else, so they don’t feel too bad about that. They battled the Horde in the Second
War and have a bit of a grudge against orcs, but gnomes are a kindly and forgiving lot and are willing to give the orcs a second chance. Gnomes and goblins have always been rivals — though whether this rivalry is friendly or brutal depends on the individuals involved.

Gnomes have not been on Kalimdor long enough to form proper opinions about its denizens. Tauren and night elves both seem rather rustic for gnome sensibilities — but they can make friends with anyone.

### Names
Gnome parents name their children at birth. Gnomes have family names that represent an honored ancestor’s achievements, but they only keep these names until some time in their 30s. Gnome society expects them to have made their own achievements by then, and thus the gnome invents a new name that represents their own accomplish-ments. This name then takes the place of his family name.

## Draenei
*In moments of great strife, I gaze into the heavens and see just how far we have already come.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Prophet Velen* &nbsp;</div>

### Introduction
Thousands of years ago, the titan Sargeras shattered the tranquility of Argus by offering the eredar immeasurable knowledge and power. The eredar were a knowledge-seeking race and accepted his offer. He bathed them in his fel might, turning them into demonic beings of the burning legion called Man'ari. The prophet Velen got a troubling vision of what his race would become, and fled Argus with his followers by the help of the divine Naaru, who renamed them draenei, or "Exiled Ones" in the common tongue.

The draenei refer to their corrupted brethren as man'ari, meaning "Unnatural Being". Although both originate from the eredar race, neither the draenei or man'ari consider themselves eredars anymore.

### Alien Appearance
While they stand tall and proud, they resemble no other race on Azeroth. Their skin ranges from rose white, to dark violet colors. They stand slightly taller than humans on average, ranging from well over 6 feet tall to just over 8 feet. They are generally more muscular than other races, with double jointed legs ending in hooves, weighing 250 pounds or more. Males and females are about the same height, and male are only marginally heavier than females.

Both genders have tendrils in their head as part of their hair or beard, and both have horns, it is common though for females to have drastically larger horns than males. They also have slender tails, males being considerably longer and thicker than females.

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:390px'></div>

Broken draenei, although having many of their pure kins features have noticeable differences, their faces are less structured, and appear more flat than their kins beautiful features. They stand shorter than exodar draenei, their skin hard and cracked like stone, appearing more human than exodar draenei with single jointed legs.

### The Divine Naaru
During the draenei's journey, the enigmatic naaru race taught them the ways of the light, though they already had a certain experience with it through Velen and T'uure. The naaru explained that there were other forces in the cosmos that would stand against the Burning Legion.

The naaru bestowed a blessing, the Gift of the Naaru, upon the draenei to signify their new connection the light. Deeply affected by the naaru's words, the draenei vowed to honor the it and uphold the naaru's ideals.

### Affiliation
Due to the draenei's friendly and honorable attitude, they tend to get along well with other races, especially those who belong to the Alliance who welcomed them into their allegiance, even though not all races return their kindness. Draenei have very strong ties with the night elves, who were the first of the Alliance to greet the draenei and welcome them.

Draenei hate orcs for the kins actions on Draenor, leading to a large distrust from the draenei side of the horde and its allied races.

### Names 
Draenei, unlike most races, do not have last names. Their parents give them a name at their birth. Upon a draenei reaching adulthood they choose a name for themselves that they keep for the rest of their life.

## Worgen
*Resembling a cross between human and dire wolf, the hunched over creature is roughly humanoid. Its body is covered in coarse, fur with twitching claws and snarling teeth. The creature's eyes are mottled yellow in colour, unblinking and devoid of any discernible emotion.*

### Introduction
Worgens were created during the War of the Satyr by the priestess Belysra Starbreeze and the druid Ralaar Fangfire who were trying to find a solution to the wolf pack form's uncontrollable nature. The form embodied the full fury of the wolf Ancient Goldrinn, something the druids had never been able to command. Belysra and Ralaar believed that the magic of Elune could tame its uncontrollable rage. Leading a ritual and mixing the power of the moon Elune, with the Druids of the Pack's pack form, resulting in the creation of the worgen. Unfortunately Goldrinn's fury was overwhelming. The worgen turned against the night elves, and Malfurion was forced to seal them within the Emerald Dream after it was discovered that their bite turned other night elves into more worgen, through what is now called the worgen curse.

Centuries later, they were freed from the Dream in order to fight the undead Scourge for Gilneas. While extremely effective against the undead army, the worgen then turned on the Gilnean, prompting them to close the Greymane Wall. While no worgen managed to enter the city, humans who had been bitten by them did. They would turn into worgen themselves and spread the curse to the whole of Gilneas, including King Genn Greymane. After being taught how to control their inner beast by the night elves, many worgen are now members of the Alliance.

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:570px'></div>

### Mindful Hunters
Worgens generally prefer more natural habitats like forests, they are experienced hunters and have a propensity to hunt. Once bitten, worgen go through stages of the mindless ferocity,eventually losing their last vestiges of their former lives and gaining a full feral mentality.

Worgen must always control their emotions lest they lose themselves to their feral instincts. They can temporarily keep their sanity in dire moments through an injection created by Gilnean alchemists, called Krennan Aranas.

### Affiliation
Worgens that are in control of their emotions are a part of the alliance, originally being humans themselves, they have a deep connection with the Stormwind Humans.

The respect the night elves, even though they were the origin of their curse, yet without them, the worgens would be feral beasts. They have a deep hatred for the forsaken and the scourge, after their successful overtaking of the Gilnean Kingdom. 

### Names
Worgens were once gilnean humans, and uses human naming conventions. Many worgens though have forgotten their full name, and often go only by their first name, and take on last names of their own based on their achievements as a worgen.

## Orc
*To pretend the demonic corruption did not exist is to forget how dreadful the impact was. To make ourselves into victims, rather than claiming our participation in our own destruction. We chose this path, we orcs. We chose it right up until it was too late to turn back. And having made that choice, we can, with the knowledge that we have of the end of that dark and shameful road, choose not to take it.*

### Introduction
When the orcs were freed from the Burning Legion, they experienced a spiritual revolution as the unnatural bloodlust left their bodies, connecting them with states of heart and mind that were common to their ancestors. This new generation of orcs for the most part followed Thrall as he forged to reform the Horde through shamanism and tribal tradition.

Though prone to fits of rage in warfare, orcs tend to display a curious feral grace that can rival even the finest fencing of an elven noble. The orcs of today continue to stand in drastic contrast to those that were enslaved by the Burning Legion, who embodied a bestial and diabolical force which was barely being controlled by warlock magic.

### Mindful Race
To orcs, prowess in battle bestows great personal honor on an individual. This notion of honor pervades every echelon of orcish culture, and the loss or gain of honor has equal consequence to all orcs regardless of their stature in society. 

Even the naming of orcs is temporary until they have performed rites of passage; only when orcs bring honor to themselves and thus to their clan do elders grant them adult names based upon their deeds. Orcs may appear quick to anger but they are tempered by the wisdom of the shamans, who are revered across Horde society.

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:369px'></div>

While many in the Alliance still perceive the orcs as brutish or even mindless, they have forged a complex culture embracing many occupations and many different races. No doubt Thrall's leadership aided in bringing this about, yet it is apparent that the Alliance has underestimated the orcs' ability to construct a society that is highly influential in world affairs.

### Spiritual
As far back as orcish history has been recorded, shaman have been mentioned, and learning to speak with the elemental spirits of Draenor was a pivotal achievement in destiny for the orc clans. The first orcs to learn the ways of shamanism hailed from the Shadowmoon clan, but many clans claim the mythical "First Shaman" arose from their ranks, even though the truth is that no one is sure of his or her allegiance.

Several orc shaman worship or at least acknowledge the Earth Mother, the benevolent creator deity primarily worshipped by the tauren.

### Frightful Appearance
Orc males are massive and brutish looking creatures. Weighing in at 250 to 300 pounds and standing from 6 to 7 feet in height, they are not a small race. Even orc women tend to be only a half-foot or so shorter than most males, having broad shoulders and muscular, powerful bodies.

Orcs tend to have bristly hair and beards, often black or brown in color. Their skin ranges from a light green to a dark drab olive. Eyes range in color from a fierce red to a pale blue. Orcs have broad, flat noses, tusk-like teeth jutting from their lower and sometimes upper jaws, and large, pointed ears. They favor clothes of hide, and armor and arm themselves with a variety of gear.

### Affiliation
Thrall formed the Horde with determination and sheer will, and created an alliance of races that has shaken the foundations of the world to its core. Having destroyed the legacy of Grom Hellscream by bringing the orcs out of the depths of demon worship and servitude to unseen powers.

## Forsaken
*Death offered no escape for the scores of humans killed during the Lich King’s campaign to scour the living from Lordaeron. Instead, the kingdom’s fallen were risen into undeath as Scourge minions and forced to wage an unholy war against everything. . . and everyone. . . that they once held dear.*

### Introduction
Undead humans and elves freed from the Lich King’s control, the Forsaken are a strange and dark force. Hailing from the twisted, skittering darkness of Undercity, the Forsaken are nominally allied with the Horde but serve only themselves.

Under the Lich Kings crusade, the elven Ranger General Sylvanas Windrunner fell in combat. Prince Arthas raised her as a banshee and compelled her to follow his command. When the Lich King’s power waned in the incidents surrounding the Frozen Throne, Sylvanas harnessed her fury and tore herself free from his skeletal grasp. She freed many other undead as well, and recruited powerful allies from the Burning Legion and the surrounding ogre clans. Sylvanas dubbed her new force the Forsaken, and the undead established their capital in the labyrinthine crypts beneath Lordaeron’s capital city. Their sprawling, subterranean realm now called Undercity.

### Necessary Alliance
The Forsaken originally became allies of the Horde out of necessity and convenience. They have no love for orcs, tauren or any other living creature, but they need time to strike against the Scourge and allies to help them do it. The Forsaken claim that they joined the Horde to prove their desire to leave their evil ways behind, but no one really believes this. The Horde accepts the forsaken’s help, as they do indeed have a common enemy: the Scourge. The Horde is leery of the forsaken’s tactics, however, and keeps watchful eyes on them.

Though initially the Forsaken alliance with the Horde was one of pure convenience, in recent times it appears that their position in the faction has begun to solidify and many, though not all, of the Forsaken appear to be more or less loyal to the Horde now. 

<br>
<div style='margin-top:545px'></div>

### Strange Behaviors
Forsaken culture is strange, a perverse combination of the lives they once knew as mortals and the mindless slavery they experienced in the Scourge, colored by white-hot rage toward the Lich King and an almost equally intense devotion to their queen. 

Some Forsaken attempt to reclaim their humanity by acting in kind and helpful ways. Others allow hatred to fester into cruelty and rage.

### Extreme Alchemists
Never sleeping, eating or falling ill, abandoned by those they once loved, the Forsaken have a brutal set of priorities. 

A great portion of their efforts focus on dark alchemy, and the Royal Apothecary Society commands great power in Undercity’s oily tunnels. The apothecaries constantly send Forsaken on missions to gather odd materials for their twisted experiments. Rumors tell that the undead creatures are working to create a plague that will exterminate the Scourge and every living being on Azeroth.

### Dreadful Looks
Forsaken, unsurprisingly, look like dead people. Their skin is gray and rotting, showing bone and flesh in places. Their pupil-less eyes glow with dim, white ghostlight. Their muscles are withered, making them scrawny. Their move-ments are slow but jagged. Necromantic magic keeps them preserved, but natural decay still proceeds, just at an extremely slow rate compared to normal.

<div style='margin-top:320px;'></div>

### Affiliation
Though the Forsaken do not trust anyone and no one trusts them, they are members of the Horde and, for now, do their best to help their allies and placate their ambassadors. Forsaken have even less love for the Alliance, particularly because they clash constantly with the human organization called the Scarlet Crusade.

The only other Horde faction they have a semblance of trust with is Silvermoon City and the blood elves. This is because their ruler Sylvanas Windrunner, and a small portion of forsaken were once blood elves.

### Names
Most forsaken keep the human or blood elven name they had when they were alive. If a forsaken cannot remember their name, or simply wishes to change it, they make up a suitable name or read one from a headstone. Some invent surnames that imply their desire to eradicate the Scourge or about their undead nature.

### Forsaken Traits
Your forsaken character has certain traits deriving from humans, as well as forsaken traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Forsakens do not age, they are undead. The age they were when brought back as forsaken is the age they will be until destroyed.

***Alignment.*** Forsakens alignment varies, as their race origin, most tend to become more chaotic, and very few keep to good after decades of being an undead.

***Size.*** Forsaken size reflects that of their living counter-parts. Many getting more hunched over with the decades. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Forsakens can see normal in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:350px;'></div>

#### Forsaken Human

***Ability Score Increase.*** One other ability scores of your choice increases by 1.

## Tauren
*Our people have walked this land for many, many years, and in that time have learned much about the world. Our allies will need to look to us for wisdom and guidance. My father once made a promise to the Horde, to repay a debt we owed them for their service to our race. I, for one, intend to deliver on that promise.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— High Chieftain Baine Bloodhoof* &nbsp;</div>

### Introduction
The plains of Kalimdor have long been a home to these gargantuan nomads. The tauren are a race of spiritual shamans, hunters, and fighters, who long ago developed a complex culture and system of living without the aid of stonework, steel or conquest. This is not to say that the tauren are a race of pacifists, when they are angered they are capable of retaliating with swift and decisive brutality. 

The tauren are a noble race that embrace the natural world. They have shed their nomadic roots and united in their ancestral lands. Their race may be one of spirituality, reverence for nature, and respect for elders, but it also possesses powerful warriors that willingly fight when the situation demands it. Although strong and capable warriors when roused in battle, most tauren reserve combat for when all other options are exhausted. 

They prefer course of wise discussion and careful rumination before embarking on any great endeavor, and they have great respect for the wise, spiritual and elderly among their people. The tauren are not wrathful by nature, but sometimes a thirst for justice causes them to take up arms in anger. 

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:378px'></div>

### Peaceful Race
Tauren have no love for bloodshed, as their deep spiritual beliefs do not have a place for warfare. The elders of a tribe solve most issues, or two tauren might resolve a conflict with a ritual challenge resembling a duel. 

Having become members of the Horde, the introspective race has been involved in more and more conflict, creating a demand for tauren warriors and healers. Many must spend time putting great thought into the actions they perform on the field of battle. Taking another life, whether it is man or beast, is an act filled with great significance and responsibility to the tauren.

### Majestic Appearance
Tauren are large, and muscular with bull-like heads. Males average 7 1/2 feet tall and 400 pounds, while females are usually a bit shorter and lighter. Tauren are mostly muscle, having incredibly developed physiques and brawny frames most suitable for combat. Soft, downy fur covers the tauren body, with manes growing along head and neck, the lengths of the arms, and the shins.

Coloration can range from solid black to blond and even to white, or mottled pelts with a range of spots and different colors. Horns are most prominent on males, although all tauren have horns.

### Affiliation
Tauren are members of the horde. When they first encountered the orcs, the tauren recognized them as spiritual brethrens. No other race shared such a similar outlook on the world, and the shamans of both races met frequently to discuss the matters of the spirit world. The tauren allied with the orcs out of a shared vision, one of a collective of allies keeping each other well guarded. 

While the tauren see the orcs and trolls as friends to welcome, they rarely trust the forsaken with more than a nod and a place to set their withered feet, and give blood elves the same treatment, the taint of magic still lingering on the blood elven spirit is a poisonous air to the tauren, a stench of the soul that they cannot tolerate for long.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tauren bear no personal ill will to members of the Alliance unless directly threatened by them. They view night elves with awe and fear. Tauren and night elves have coexisted on Kalimdor for centuries, and tauren have long seen the Kaldorei as a mythical race of demigods, wielders of great magic and steeped in natural powers.

### Names 
The language of the tauren is often harsh and low sounding, which is reflected in the names of their children. The last name of a tauren is usually a family name, handed down through the generations. If the tauren has performed some act that has made an impression on the elders of his tribe, however, he may choose to take on his own last name to commemorate that act.

## Troll
*Your ancestry dates back to the dawn of the world. Great were the ancient empires of the trolls. I see a spark in your eyes, a powerful will - you wish to be great again, yes?* 
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Lorewalker Cho* &nbsp;</div>

### Introduction
The jungle trolls are sometimes referred to as Gurubashi trolls, after the ancient empire of the same name. Their capital, Zul'Gurub, is located in Stranglethorn Vale, along with many smaller towns, cities, and villages, many of which are in a state of ruin or disrepair. The largest jungle troll settlement outside Stranglethorn is Sen'jin Village founded by the Darkspear tribe, who had been displaced from their exile on the Broken Isles and Echo Isles.

Forest trolls hold all other races in contempt — especially blood elves, whom they consider the despoilers of their ancient homeland. They will only work with others if it means the elimination of an even more hated enemy. Forest troll culture is tribal and primitive. Though not as violent as their ice troll cousins, forest trolls nonetheless have a fearsome reputation in battle.

Ice trolls are a subspecies of troll that lives in cold climates. They have angular features, bright blue eyes, and mottled blue-white skin covered in hides and pelts. This troll has blue-white skin under grayish leather armor, and he sports a red mohawk. 

Ice trolls are generally evil and like most trolls, they are fierce protectors of their homes and may attack travelers to gain weapons, materials, clothing and food. They practice cannibalism and sometimes eat their slain enemies raw.

### Cannibalists and Voodooism
Cannibalism was a relatively common practice amongst trolls, although through the decades, and with their integration into the horde, their cannibalism had been frowned upon by most, and has since been made a forbidding practice by the horde, some still practice it, but non do so openly.

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:550px'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all trolls practice voodoo, but it is widespread. It was given to the trolls by their worshiped gods the Loa, and the exact emergence of voodoo among the trolls is unknown, for most tribes that possess such knowledge are unwilling to share it with outsiders.

### Tall and Muscular
Trolls are often tall, lanky, and muscular. They have both elven and orcish characteristics with their fierce fangs and long ears. Their long arms, strong legs and quick reflexes make them adept hunters. 

Trolls have only two fingers and a thumb on their hands, and they have only two toes on each foot. Some trolls have a toenail on their heels, and they do not wear standard shoes or boots due to their unusual foot shape and comfort in wading barefooted within different terrains.

### Affiliation
Trolls are steadfast members of the horde. Though they practice voodoo and many retain their savage natures, they are respected within the horde by the orcs. They feel a great debt to them, and their time fighting alongside the tauren has made them friends of these creatures as well. They are suspicious of the forsaken, but so is everyone else.

The troll tribes doesn’t really hate the Alliance races, but their loyalty to the Horde and their bloodthirstiness makes the Alliance a great target. However, their respect for the Warchief prevents them from waging a private war against Theramore.

### Names 
Troll names look simple but are surprisingly complex. Their language is largely syllabic, and various syllables can be added to the beginning or end of a troll’s name to denote status and ability. Trolls don't have family names, although some use their clan name as their surname.

<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Kael'thas Sunstrider* &nbsp;</div>

### Introduction
Nourished and strengthened by the Sunwell’s potent energies, the high elves’ enchanted kingdom of Quel'Thalas prospered within the verdant forests north of Lordaeron. 

During the Third War, the high elves were nearly scoured from Azeroth. Led by the death knight Arthas, the scourge army slaughtered almost all of the kingdom’s population. In the slaughter, Arthas tainted the sunwell, reanimating a lost necromancer. Prince Kael'thas rushed to his homeland's aid, and the survivors of the onslaught were renamed 'blood elves' in honor of their fallen kin. The blood elves grew addicted to the sunwells tainted energies. Kael'thas desperately searching for a cure for his kin, traveling the world to avenge his people and find a way to sate their hunger for magic.

Kael'thas assured his people he would return to Quel'Thalas and lead them to paradise, yet on Outland, the prince became twisted with the corrupting essence wielded by the demonic Burning Legion. Getting under the sway of the Legion's commander. The prince was later killed on his return to Quel'Thalas for his treachery, and with the aid of the draenei prophet, Velen, the magic taint lingering on the sunwell was vanquished, restore it as a fount of both arcane and holy energy.

<div style='margin-top:400px'></div>

Inspired by the Sunwell's rebirth, the blood elves have since entered into a shining new era in their ancient race's history. Although some elves remain hesitant to abandon their dependence on arcane magic, others have embraced change for the betterment of Quel'Thalas. 

### Crimson
As a culture, the sin'dorei have retained the look and feel of their fallen high elven kingdom, though have developed a greater penchant for the colour of crimson: the colour of their namesake. Crimson-red robes, decor and armour have become far more commonplace within blood elven society prior to the fall of the high elven people, a reference to the blood of their many brethren who had perished in the Third War. The iconic and traditional blood elven colours are red, gold, and to a lesser extent, blue – all of which can be seen on their racial crest, the Icon of Blood.

### Proud Society
In general, the blood elves are a proud, pragmatic, and somewhat jingoistic people; they place great emphasis on their love for their homeland, and are ruthless to their enemies. Their reputation for isolationism is well-earned, and they prefer to keep to their own kind, although excep-tions to this stereotype exist. Blood elves are a resilient race of survivors, and their most prominent figures stand as beacons of courage, tenacity, and the strength to fight on, regardless of what foes stand in their way.

### Beautiful and Graceful
Blood elves are, biologically and physiologically high elves. With the largest difference being their emerald glowing eyes compared to the high elves blue.

They are slenderly built, standing at 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet, and averaging at 150 pounds. They have long pointy ears, high cheekbones, and are generally considered highly attractive by the standards of most mortal races. Both males and females commonly have long hair in light colorations, and males ability to grow facial hair is—

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; —limited, resulting in very few having beards beyond an inch, and large facial hairs being completely absent.

### Affiliation
Blood elves are members of the Horde. Though the Horde was reluctant to forge allegiances with the sin'dorei, the vouching of Sylvanas, and the general consensus that the blood elves could bring to the table what the Horde had previously lacked, paved the way to Quel'Thalas being accepted as an equal independent nation of the Horde.

### Names
Blood elves for the most part use high elven names, origi-nally being of high elven kin, many have either kept their past name, or given high elven names to their children. Unlike high elves, blood elven surnames are generally more aggressive, blood elves don't keep family names, with the exception of highborne wanting to carry on a certain name.

## Goblin
*I never cover up the things I'm proud of. If the world was gonna split in half tomorrow, I’d buy the Dark Portal, slap a toll booth on it, and charge refugees the last of their pocket change, the rings off their fingers, a bite of their meal, and a contractual obligation to build me a rocket palace in the skies of Nagrand. It’s the goblin way! Supply and demand! Deal with it!*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Trade Prince Jastor Gallywix* &nbsp;</div>

### Introduction
Slaves of the jungle trolls on their home isle, forced to mine kaja'mite ore out of the volcanic bowels of Mount Kajaro. The ore had an unexpected effect on the goblins, granting them cunning intelligence. They began to rebel in secret, engineering artifacts, and brewing alchemical substances to successfully overthrow their oppressors and claim Kezan their homeland.

Their prior prison become an expanding empire in the mines they had dugged. To their dismay, the effects of the kaja'mite ore wore off, and their increased intelligence waned, as the ore itself became scarce and dwindled. Their brilliant engineering dwindled in ingenuity, looking haphazardly put together. Their remaining craftiness and greed soon took its place, lifting the race to preeminence as masters of mercantilism. Great fortunes were amassed, and the isle became a hub for goblin traders.

### Technology
Goblins love of mechanics often places them into direct competition with gnomes who enjoy similar devices. The competition between goblins and gnomes seems to be friendly. Whether clockwork shredders that allow a single goblin to do as much harvesting as 10 field hands or zeppelin-like airships that can ferry troops over otherwise impassable terrain, the goblins' inventions have become legendary. Such technological ingenuity is as central to the goblins' rise among the races as any trading prowess.

Even with the malfunctions and explosions that occur, goblin technology is proving to be of a quality that rivals the dwarves and their firearms.

<div style='margin-top:490px'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While other races often try to build reliable machines that would stay for grandchildren, goblin aims for device of the marginally bearable reliability that should only last enough to make its construction reasonable. Weird as it is, this approach allows to build more machines, or to build a more complex and powerful machine using the same time and resources.

### Born Traders
Goblins have taken to the role of merchants, and it's hard to travel for more than a week or two without stumbling across a goblin shop of some size. Goblin shops can be found nearly anywhere on Azeroth, seemingly regardless of whether or not there are towns nearby and heedless of dangers such as the Scourge. The goblins will sell anything to anyone, at only slightly inflated prices.

Though many shops remain independent, a growing number of them have signs declaring that they are owned and operated by the Venture Company, which the proprietors claim is headquartered in a faraway city ruled by goblins where the streets are paved with gold.

The goblins are also legendary for the sheer variety of trade in which they are willing to indulge and for their tenacity in bargaining. 

### Small But Standing Tall
Goblins are slight and wiry, averaging 3 feet in height and weighing between 30 and 50 pounds. They have long, sharp noses, chins and ears, and green skin. Their arms are long and slender and their fingers deft. 

Female goblins are on average taller than most male goblins, even though the difference is miniscule, and close to nothing compared to other races.

### Affiliation
Goblins have found a recent enemy in the Alliance. Unpro-fitable encounters with the secretive SI:7 forces have driven them away from comfortable neutrality with both sides. Forcing them to reforge old pacts with their business partners and now allies the horde.

Although the Alliance is not fond of goblins, they still for the most part do trade with them when stumbled upon outside Stormwinds borders. Only member of the Alliance they tend to stay from are night elves, who carry a deep dislike towards the goblins because of their disrespect for the nature they continuously harvest for resources.

### Names 
Every goblin has a given name and a family name. The family names portray some ancestor’s achievement, though a goblin may take a new family name if he feels he has made an accomplishment that outstrips that of his forebear.

## Pandaren
*To ask why we fight... is to ask why the leaves fall. It is in their nature. Perhaps, there is a better question. Why do we fight? To protect Home, and Family... To preserve Balance, and bring Harmony. For my kind, the true question is: What is worth fighting for?*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Chen Stormstout* &nbsp;</div>

### Introduction
The pandaren have long been a mystery to other races of Azeroth, their history stretching back thousands of years, to before the raise of the kaldorei. Denizens of a wondrous and fertile land, the pandaren were slaves to the ancient warlords known as the mogu. Through tenacity, diplomacy, and a unique form of unarmed combat, they staged a successful revolution that deposed the mogu, and established the foundation of the pandaren empire that would prosper for thousands of years.

During the bleak days that preceded the sundering of the world, the pandaren emperor shrouded their land in an impenetrable mist for ten thousand years. As the years unveiled, and the pandarian isle reentered Azeroth, both factions wanted a part of the unexplored isle and what lied upon it.

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:530px'></div>

### A Spiritual Race
Pandaren have a fierce and deep belief in the connection of the material and spiritual worlds. In many ways their faith mirrors the ancient beliefs of the night elves, and the tribal beliefs of the tauren, troll, and orc races. 

Like the Tauren, and Wildhammer dwarves, the pandaren follow a shamanistic faith, worshiping the Earth Mother and giving passage to their dead. They also follow a new philosophy, they are a society that reacts, instead of acting first. They claim to be the water that flows around a rock: "*The water does not push the rock out of the way, it merely goes around it*". 

They use this uncomplicated way of thinking in their everyday life. If they set their minds to a task, and they fail, then they believe they went about it the wrong way and try again.

### Covered in Fur
Pandaren are humanoid bears, generally between 5 and 6 feet tall, covered in fur from head to toe. Every pandaren has two colors of fur; one is always white but the other color ranges from black to brown to red. They have paws for hands and feet, with three fingers, a thumb and three toes. Each digit is tipped with a black claw. They refer to their hands directly as paws. While the species has a tail, there are two distinct forms. The common form is a round stub of fur, but the second form, which is long and thickens out by the end, is exclusive to red-and-white females.

Pandaren are usually very rotund, which tend to be a point of pride in their society

### Affiliation
The pandaren are neutral, and relatively new upon the face of Azeroth, having been welcomed into both Alliance and Horde cities due to the members interest in the race.

They carry no personal ill feelings against races of Azeroth, having only had a brief time to learn the history of every race. They do though carry a certain fondness for the dwarves because of their brewing of ale, and the taurens because of their spirituality. As they stand now, pandaren as a race have not pledged their allegiance with either side, a few exceptions have occurred of individuals officially siding with one faction or the other.

### Names
Pandaren naming practices are similar to those of humans, each pandaren are given a name at birth, and carries on the family name of their parents. Some pandaren are known to take a new family name reflecting their own achieve-ments in life, yet such practices are uncommon.

### Pandaren Traits
Pandaren has the following characteristics, harnessed through their immense training.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Much like humans, pandaren reach adulthood in their late teens, and live approximately to become the same age as strong humans, most dying within a century.

***Alignment.*** Pandaren are a peaceful folk, and for the most part tend towards neutral or good, finding a pandaren that is of an evil alignment, is uncommon.

***Size.*** Pandaren are between 5 to 6 feet tall, and always on the chubby side, but never lets that hinder them or take offence from it. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Bouncy.*** You have resistance against bludgeoning damage taken from falling.

***Gourmand.*** You are proficient in the brewer's supplies and cook's utensils.

***Pandaren Stomach.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poison.

***Quaking Palm.*** Upon hitting a target with an unarmed strike, you may transfer chi from your body to the targets, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or be stunned until the end of your next turn. Wisdom is your saving throw ability for this feature. You can't use this fea-ture again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write, Common and Mogu. Mogu is the language of Pandaria, forced upon the inhabitants by the mogu empire. It is a strange and unfamiliar language to the rest of Azeroth, with a multitide of words meaning one common thing.

# Chapter 2: Classes
Heroes are extraordinary people, driven by a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They arc heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of Azeroth and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can't stand against.

Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It's more than a profession; it's your character's calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the multiverse. A warrior, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A priest, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant in a god's unfolding plan or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the warrior has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the priest might know a number of healers, paladins, and devotees who share his faith.

Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a warrior's mastery of weapons and armor, and a mage's spells. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing features often improve. 

Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and a detailed explanation of each one.

Heroes sometimes advance in more than one class. A rogue might switch direction in life and swear the oath of a paladin. A barbaric warrior might discover latent magical ability and dabble in the arcanic classes while continuing to advance as a warrior. Elves are known to combine martial mastery with magical training and advance as warriors and mages simultaneously.

Optional rules for combining classes in this way, called multiclassing, appear in chapter 5.

Ten classes — listed in the Classes table — are found in the World of Warcraft and define the spectrum of heroes.

## Druid
*Standing in the way of nature is heresy. Even when nature's force is a destructive one.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Malfurion Stormrage* &nbsp;</div>

Clutching an engraved staff stitched with leaves, a night elf summons the powers of elune, calling down raw blue energy of the moon upon a terrible foe, smashing upon its body and encasing it hole for a brief moment.

Crouching out of sight  on a low hanging tree branch, in the form of a large feral tiger, a worgen scouts out from his hiding stop towards the constructions of Zul'Gurub. Watching every move of the jungle trolls patrolling.

Holding near her sickle and staff, a young tauren druid is making beautiful ritual, making tiny seeds sprinkle into a perfect circle of faintly glowing green lights, healing an endured ally to the best of her capabilities.

Rushing forward towards his companions aid, rumbling the ground as his body transforms into a giant bear creature with tusks, an experienced troll runs to his allies aid, blocking a fatal blow with its fur.

### Nature's Power
Druids harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. With experience, druids can unleash nature’s raw energy against their enemies, raining celestial fury on them from a great distance, binding them with enchanted vines, or ensnaring them in unrelenting cyclones. Druids can also direct this power to heal wounds and restore life to fallen allies. 

They are deeply in tune with the animal spirits of Azeroth. As master shapeshifters, druids can take on the forms of a variety of beasts, morphing into a bear, cat, creatures of water, and creatures of air with ease. This flexibility allows them to fill different roles during their adventures, tearing enemies to shreds one minute and surveying the battlefield from the sky the next. These keepers of the natural order are among the most versatile heroes in Azeroth, and they must be prepared to adjust to new challenges on a moment’s notice.

### Protectors of Balance
Guardians of nature who seek to preserve balance and protect life, Druids have unmatched versatility on the field of battle. This is in part because druidism is much more than a fighting discipline.

It’s a way of life steeped in traditions so ancient that even the origin of their kind is preserved largely in mythology passed on through millennia.

Druids harness nature’s raw energy for an incredible breadth of offensive and defensive abilities, as well as to restore life to the wounded. Through communion with nature and the demigod Cenarius, Lord of the Forest, Druids are supernaturally endowed with the gift of shapeshifting, allowing them to take the form of all manner of nature’s creature and access powers as distinct as they are diverse.

### Creating a Druid
When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. 

Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny. Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home.

#### Quick Build
You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. (Feral druids make their Dexte-rity higher than Constitution, and Guardians Strength.)

## Class Features
As a druid, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per druid level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 + your Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons
- **Tools:** Herbalism kit

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPPYV7h.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:0px; width:1200px' />

\pagebreakNum

___
- **Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom
- **Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling. lnsight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- *(a)* a quarterstaff or *(b)* any simple weapon
- *(a)* a dagger or *(b)* any simple weapon
- Leather armor, explorer's pack, and a druidic focus

### Druidic
You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak, read and write Druidic, a language sacred to druids that is not taught to outsides without severe consequences for the teacher and teached.

### Spellcasting
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the druid spell list.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast a druid spell, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You re-gain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. 

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attune-ment to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack with one.

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
</div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

\columnbreak

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

### Shapeshifting
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of certain beasts. You can shapeshift into a known shape as often as you wish.

Your druid level determines the shapes you can trans-form into, as shown in the Shapeshifts table. At 2nd level, for example, you can assume the shape of a large feral cat, or a thick furred bear. Each shapeshift and its benefits are described in Appendix A at the end of this book.

##### Shapeshifts
|&nbsp; Level |&nbsp;&nbsp;| Shapeshift Forms |
|:-----------:|:-|:---------------------------|
|&nbsp; 2nd   || Cat and Bear                 |
|&nbsp; 4th   || Travel                       |
|&nbsp; 6th   || Aquatic                      |
|&nbsp; 8th   || Flight                       |

You can stay shapeshifted for as long as you wish. You can revert to your normal form by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

- Your retain your game statistics, alignment, and person-ality. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the shape.
- Shapeshifting does not change your hit points, and any damage taken whilst in a shapeshift carries over to your humanoid form upon reverting back.
- You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabil-ities of your shapeshift. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you've already cast.
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the shapeshift is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, or merges into your new form. Merged equipment has no effect until you leave the shape.

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

> ##### Druidic Forms
> Shapeshifts are an extension of the druid. Both as a person, but also as a race, a taurens shape-shift might grow horns similar to his own. An orc or troll might want their forms to have tusks, and a night elf might decorate theirs with signs of elune. Likewise, their beast might be different, one may choose a slim panther, and another a strong lion, or another feline beast.
>
> A list of the most common beasts druids have taken for that shape. Choose one of them as your shape, and modify its appearance as you wish to fit your race, or talk to your DM about becoming something not on the list.

### Druid Paths
At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a druidic path: Balance, Feral, Guardian, or Restoration, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you featur-es at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 17th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Timeless Body
Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield has caused you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

### Soul of the Forest
At 20th level, your connection with nature has grown to an incredible level, deepening beasts respect for you, and mak-ing you able to conjure a gateway to the Emerald Dream.

Using 10 minutes in an area of unspoiled nature, you can conjure a gateway to the Emerald Dream, the entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when conjuring the gateway can enter into the Emerald Dream for as long as the gate-way remains open. You can open and close the gateway if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the gateway on Azeroth crumbles and is effectively invisible. The gateway remains conjured for 24 hours, at which point it crumbles entire and cannot be conjured again for 7 days.

In addition, beasts and plants of the wilds can sense your connection to nature, giving you advantage on all skill and ability checks made to communicate with them.

## Druid Paths
Although all druids have a deep love for nature and wilderness, some druids have a deeper love for their animal shapeshifts, preferring that form over their humanoid one. Others for the goddess Elune, and some stay true to the druidic tradition of preserving life, druids fall into four categories: Balance, Feral, Guardian, or Restoration druids.

### Path of Balance
Druids on the path of balance leverage the sacred powers of the moon, the sun, and the stars, accessing a mixture of arcane and nature powers to aid in the fight against the imbalance that threatens the natural order of all things.

#### Bonus Cantrip
When you choose this path at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.

#### Innervate
Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

\columnbreak

<br>

<div style='margin-top:315px;'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can re-cover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

#### Moonkin Shapeshift
Beginning at 6th level, you learn how to shapeshift into a moonkin. While shapeshifted into a moonkin you are con-sidered unarmored, and add your Wisdom modifier to your armor class. Additionally, you ignore the shapeshifting rule concerning spellcasting whilst a moonkin, and when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you add half your druid level to the damage dealt.

Unlike your other shapeshifts, you can only use this feature twice. Regaining expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. You can stay as a moonkin for a number of hours equal to half your druid level. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. All other shapeshifting rules still apply.

#### Astral Influence
At 10th level, as a bonus action, you can replace one spell you have prepared with another spell from the druid spell list. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Fury of Elune
Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal force damage to the attacker. The damage equals your druid level. The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet away from you.

#### Chosen of Elune
At 17th level, your connection to Elune has strengthened you beyond measure. Your moonkin shapeshift no longer has a usage limitation, and you are able to stay shape-shifted for as long as you wish.

Additionally, you always have the *moonbeam* spell pre-pared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you prepare each day. You can cast *moonbeam* as a 4th-level spell without expending a spell slot.

Once you cast *moonbeam* in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.

### Path of Feral
Druids on the feral path seek an understanding, and visceral connection to the wild, and in combat take the form of a deadly feline predator. Feral druids become ferocious, agile stalkers. Many feral druids coming to prefer the appearance of their feline selves over their humanoid shape.

#### Predatorial Preference
When you choose this path at 2nd level, you've begun to spend more time as a feline. Your proficiency in Intelli-gence saving throws permanently changes to Dexterity.

#### Feral Caster
Starting at 2nd level, you actively spend more time on your predatory skills than your spellcasting, making it difficult for you to cast spells beyond 5th level. To cast a spell of 6th level or higher, you must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 10 + the spells level. On a failure, the spell fails and the spell slot is expended.

You can expend spell slots for various abilities within your cat form, each of which are detailed below.

##### Feral Enhancements
These enhancements are presented in alphabetical order.

\columnbreak

<br>

When you choose this path at 2nd level, you've begun to spend more time as a bear. Your proficiency in Intelligence saving throws permanently changes to Constitution.

While raging as a bear, you gain the following benefits.
 - You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
 - When you make a melee weapon attack, you add your proficiency bonus to the damage roll.
 - You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

#### Bestial Caster
Starting at 2nd level, you actively spend more time on your bestial skills than your spellcasting, making it difficult for you to cast spells beyond 5th level. To cast a spell of 6th level or higher, you must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 10 + the spells level. On a failure, the spell fails and the spell slot is expended.

You can expend spell slots for various abilities within your bear form, each of which are detailed below.

##### Bestial Enhancements
These enhancements are presented in alphabetical order.

***Brambled fur.*** You can use your reaction and expend a spell slot upon taking damage to return part of the damage taken. For each level of the spell slot expended, roll 1d8, reducing your damage taken equal to the amount rolled, and returning that damage to the attacker.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPPYV7h.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:0px; width:1200px' />

\pagebreakNum

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Demoralizing Roar.*** As an action, you let out an echoing roar. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or have disadvantage on all attack rolls until the end of your next turn. A creature immune to being frightened automatically succeeds.

***Ferocious Bite.*** When you hit another creature with a bite attack, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional damage die for every two spell slot levels expended.

For example, if you expend a 1st or 2nd level spell slot, you deal 1 additional damage die, and if you expend a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you deal 2 additional damage dice.

***Mighty Bash.*** When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to attempt to stun the target. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

#### Mauler

#### Mark of Ursol
Starting at 10th level, while in bear form, you can use an action to cast the *enlarge/reduce* spell on yourself without providing any spell components or expending a spell slot. When casting the spell this way, you can only use the *enlarge* effect of it.

Once you have cast *enlarge/reduce* in this way twice, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. You can still cast it normally using an available spell slot if you have it prepared.

#### Persistent Rage
Upon reaching 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

#### Guardian of Ursoc
At 17th level, you embody the power of the wild god Ursoc. Your Strength and Constitution scores each increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.

In addition, you are able to rage an unlimited amount of times per day, effectively removing the daily limitation.

\columnbreak

### Path of Restoration
Druids of the restoration path builds a stronger bond with things that grow than the rest of their kin, gaining inspiration from the flower’s bloom, the seeds sprout, the mushroom’s spores, and the tree’s growth. 

#### Path Spells
When you choose this path at 2nd level, you learn the *resistance* cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the table below.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

|&nbsp; Druid Level |&nbsp;&nbsp;| Spells        |
|:---------:|:-|:--------------------------------|
|&nbsp; 3rd || barkskin, lesser restoration      |
|&nbsp; 5th || mass healing word, revivify       |
|&nbsp; 7th || aura of life, guardian of nature  |
|&nbsp; 9th || greater restoration, raise dead   |

#### Rejuvenation
When you choose this path at 2nd level, you gain the blessings of Elune, making you a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. You have a pool of energy represented by a number of d6s equal to your druid level.

As a bonus action, you can choose one creature that you can see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 tempor-ary hit point per die.

You regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

#### Ironbark
Beginning at 6th level, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.

#### Tranquility
Starting at 10th level, you can become as calm as spring, soothing your allies. As an action, you evoke a healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your druid level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on a construct.

Once you have used this feature, you can't use it again until you have finished a long rest.

#### Nature's Cure
When you reach 14th level, you can't be charmed or frightened, and you are immune to poison and disease.

#### Tree of Life
At 17th level, you draw strength from the world trees of Azeroth's roots. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

Wild and barbaric looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a spear in his hands, he charges in with intense fury, a large bear running at his side, roaring as he engages, cutting down one enemy after another.

Tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, a night elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the blue dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.

Holding his hand high, a blood elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Thalassian, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.

### Inescapable Stalkers
From an early age the call of the wild draws some adventurers from the comfort of their homes into the unforgiving primal world outside. Those who endure become hunters. As masters of their environment, hunters are able to slip like ghosts through the trees and lay traps in the paths of their enemies. These expert marksman drop foes dead in their tracks with flawless shots from a bow, crossbow or rifle. With the ability to wield two weapons simultaneously, hunters can unleash a flurry of blows against anyone unfortunate enough to stumble into close combat with them.

The art of survival is central to the isolated life of a hunter. Hunters track beasts with ease and enhance their own abilities by attuning themselves to the feral aspects of various creatures. Hunters are known for the lifelong bonds they form with animals of the wild, training great hawks, cats, bears, and many other beasts to fight alongside them.

<div style='margin-top:560px'></div>

### Proud Rangers
The hunter is a stalker in the wilds, living on his knowledge of survival and skill with a bow or rifle. He is deeply in tune with nature, and some of its mightiest beasts are his allies. 

Of Azeroth's many creatures, few can resist the hunter's call, and fewer can survive his fury. Hunters are as varied as the world's many climates, but they are universally renowned for their amazing abilities to find their prey and bring it down. Most hunters seek to aid the balance of nature along with their druidic allies. Elven rangers are not alone in their mastery of the wilderness. While an elven ranger prefers the bow, the hunter would rather get up close. A hunter is skilled in stealth, slipping through the woods like a ghost. 

### The Hunters Choice
The hunter is the choice of life for those who reject societies that oppress the natural role as prey and hunter, and also reject the druidic stance that we should be healers and observers rather than active participants in the "Great Hunt". 

They follow a life of reverence for nature complimenting their tradition and willingness to use man-made tools. We are all tool-using creatures after all, and it is only natural to use that advantage afforded by nature to be better hunters. There are however also those hunters who prefer a more direct approach to tracking and hunting.

### Creating a Hunter
As you create your hunter character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the hunter's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship. or was your mentor slain, perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of hunters affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.

Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?

### Animal Empathy
Your mastery of hunter lore allows you to establish a link to beasts and to the land around you. 

You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs, and actions you can take to persuade it to not attack.

You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes.

### Natural Explorer
You are familiar with natural environments and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. This grants you the following benefits:
 - You ignore difficult terrain.
 - You have advantage on initiative rolls.
 - On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted.

In addition, you are skilled at navigating the wilderness. You gain the following benefits when traveling for an hour or more.
 - Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.
 - Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
 - Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
 - If you are traveling alone with or without your pet, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
 - When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
 - While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Close Quarters Shooter 
When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to use this benefit.

\columnbreak

### Focused Combatant
Starting at 2nd level, you learn to perform powerful attacks to disable or damage your opponents through a heightened focus in combat. Your access to this focus is represented by a number of focus points. Your hunter level determines the number of focus points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the Hunter table.

You can spend these points to perform various focus features. You learn two focused attacks of your choice, which are detailed under Focused Attacks below. Each focused attack must be declared before making an attack roll. You can only use one focused attack per attack roll.

You learn an additional focused attack of your choice at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. Each time you learn a new focused attack, you can also replace one focused attack you know with another from the list.

When you spend a focus point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which your focus is regained. Additionally you regain 1 expended focus point each time you roll a 20 on the d20 roll for an attack with a weapon, or deal the killing blow to a creature of significant threat (DM's discretion).

Some of your focused attacks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the attacks effect. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Focus save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 
</div>

#### Focused Attacks
These focused attacks are presented in alphabetical order.

***Carving Strike.*** When you make a melee weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one focus point to make an attack roll against each target directly on either side of your initial attack. On a hit, roll damage for one target, any additional creature hit takes the same amount of damage.

***Concussive Attack.*** When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one focus point to attempt to dizzy your opponent. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on attacks until the end of their next turn.

***Disarming Attack.*** When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one focus point to attempt to shoot or knock an object from their hands. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop 1 held object of your choice and have that object be pushed 10 feet away in the direction of your attack.

***Piercing Shot.*** When you make a ranged weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one focus point to attempt to shoot through multiple opponents. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and you make an attack roll with disadvantage against every creature in a line directly behind the target within your first range increment.

***Steady Attack.*** When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one focus point to gain advantage on the attack roll.

***Violent Attack.*** When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend focus points to enhance the velocity of the attack. For each focus point expended, your attack deals one additional weapon damage die, to a maximum of an additional four weapon dies.

***Aimed Attack.*** When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one focus point to attempt to topple a target. On a hit, the target suffers normal damage, and must succeed Strength save or be knocked prone.

### Hunter Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a hunter archetype: Beast Master, Marksman or Surviva-list, each detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

### Animal Companion
Beginning at 3rd level, you have strengthened your bond with animals, gaining a supernatural bond with them that allows you to interact with them on a spiritual level. 

You may attempt to tame any beast that is no larger than Medium with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower. You use both natural and supernatural means to compel the crea-ture to befriend you. To do this, you must be within 30 feet of the creature and it must be able to see and hear you.

Taming an animal companion takes hours of uninter-rupted interaction, requiring a successful Animal Handling check to begin the taming process, the exact time and DC of the taming process is determined by the DM. The taming check is made with disadvantage if any creature in the area appears threatening towards the beast. If the check fails, the creature's attitude towards you doesn't change, but you cannot attempt to tame that creature again in the next 24 hours. If you succeed, the beast becomes your companion at the end of the taming process. 

You can only have one beast companion at a time, having to release your current companion before you can tame a new one. Once you have gained a beast loyalty, it gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond feature.

#### Companion's Bond
Your beast companion gains a variety of benefits once loyal.

- The beast loses its Multiattack action, if it has one. 
- Your companion obeys your commands as best it can, acting on your initiative count, its actions, decisions, attitudes and so on determined by you. If you are incapacitated or absent, the companion acts on its own.
- Your beast companion has abilities and statistics determined in part by your level. Using your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, your companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.
- Your beast gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient in all saving throws.
- For each level above 3rd, your beast companion gains an additional hit die and its maximum hit points increases accordingly. This is retroactive for companions gained at later levels.
- Whenever you gain an *Ability Score Improvement* class feature, your companions abilities improve as well, applying all the rules of increasing ability scores that would apply to you too.
- Your companions alignment changes to sharing yours.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

\columnbreak

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Fleet of Foot
Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.

### Wild Calling
At 13th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by non-magical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

### Feral Senses
Beginning at 17th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't im-pose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible crea-ture within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

### Aspect of the Wild
At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

## Hunter Archetypes
All hunters have certain things in common, such as their love for the wilderness, or their passion for beasts. But some hunters have more than love for beasts, and others a greater love for the wild, hunters fall into three categories: Beast Master, Marksman, and Survivalist.

### Beast Master
Among the most gifted hunters, there are those who have from birth felt a profound bond with the creatures of the wild. These beast masters are drawn to the perilous primal world, invigorated by its dangerous and untamed nature. Primitive landscape becomes home. Ferocious predator becomes kin.

#### Dire Tamer
At 3rd level, your way with beasts have made you able to tame more powerful, deadly beasts. You are able to tame beasts with a challenge rating as high as your hunter level divided by 4, rounded down (minimum of 1).

#### Coordinated Attack
Beginning at 7th level, you and your companion form a more potent fighting team. When you use the Attack action on your turn, if your companion can see you, it can use its reaction to make one melee attack against a creature within range of it.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Bestial Wrath
Starting at 11th level, when you animal companion takes the Attack action, the animal can make two attacks, or it can take the Multi-attack action if it has that action.

#### Monstrous Companion
At 15th level, your time spend around beasts of the wilder-ness has taught you how to act and tame ferocious beasts. Making you able to tame bestial monstrosities (DM's Dis-cretion). All of the rules of your Animal Companion and Dire Tamer features still applies.

Your monstrous beast companion gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond feature, with the exception of gain-ing hit points from 11th hunter level instead of 3rd.

### Marksman
Marksmen shroud themselves in the perils of the untamed wilds, perfecting the use of weapons that are deadliest from great range. They have little interest in gaining the loyalty of beasts. Instead, they blend into the surrounding environment, surveying predators and delivering deadly shots from great distances. 

#### Lone Wolf
At 3rd level, you begin to find your animal companion more of a hindrance than a companion, preferring to deliver your shots quietly from a distance. Giving you the following benefit when you do not have an animal companion.

As a bonus action, you designate one creature you can see within 120 feet of you as the target of this feature. The first time each turn that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon.

This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It ends early if you designate a different creature.

#### Quickshots
Starting at 7th level, your quick reaction allows you to turn a failure into a potential success. Once per turn immedi-ately after you miss with a weapon attack, you can make one additional weapon attack against the same creature.

#### Multiattack
Beginning at 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

***Barrage.*** You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within a 30-ft cone. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.

***Volley.*** You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon's range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.

#### Marksman's Focus
At 15th level, when you roll for initiative and have no focus points remaining, you regain 4 focus points.

\columnbreak

### Survival
All hunters feel a calling to the wild, but some serve as a reflection of its brutality. To them, the hunt is defined by unrelenting ferocity. Weapons of great range are thrown away for close-quarters combat.

#### Sting Vial
Starting at 3rd level, you can imbue a vial with druidic magic, making it able to assume various poisons. Your vial has a number of uses equal to your amount of focus points, but has its own pool of uses.

You can spend a use of your sting vial to apply a poison effect to your weapon. Applying a poison to your weapon requires a bonus action, and lasts until the end of your next turn, or until you successfully hit a target.

When you spend a sting vial use, it is unavailable until you finish a long rest, at the end of which your sting vial replenishes itself. The sting vial is bound to you, if handed to another creature for more than 1 minute, its content turns to water, expending all uses of your sting vial.

Your stings require your target to make a saving throw to resist its effect. The saving throw DC is equal to your Focused Combatants.

<div style='margin-top:-7px;'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Serpent Sting.*** The target must succeed a Constitution saving throw. Taking your hunter level in poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed, it is poisoned until the end of your next turn.

***Wyvern Sting.*** The target must succeed a Wisdom save or be paralyzed for 2 rounds. The paralyse ends early if the target takes any damage.

***Spider Sting.*** The target must succeed a Constitution saving throw, or be blinded until the end of your next turn.

***Scorpion Sting.*** The target must succeed an Intelligence saving throw, or be unable to cast spells until the end of your next turn.

#### Survivalist
Beginning at 7th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

In addition, when a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +2 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn

#### Camouflage
Upon reaching 11th level, your experience with the nature, has made you exceptional at making you and your allies blend in. Using 10 minutes you can cast the *pass without trace* spell. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials for you to be able to cast this spell.

#### Aspect of the Beast
At 15th level, you take on an aspect of a one of the following beasts of your choice.

***Cheetah.*** When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

***Monkey.*** When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.

***Turtle.*** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

## Mage
*Always remember that power is a double-edged blade. One side light, the other dark. It calls to you, where you are most desperate; when victory seems worth any sacrifice. There is a price to be paid for such a gift, and many eagerly accept the bargain. Power alone is not to be feared. <br>Fear, instead, those who wield it.*
<div style="text-align:Right">

*— Jaina Proudmoore* &nbsp;</div>

Clad in a golden robe, a blood elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefields and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into an engulfing conflagration.

The air shimmers, as a draenei lifts his hands above his head twisting the air around him into a barrier of force engulfs him, blocking a barrage of attacks against him.

Golden eyes flashing, a human stomps his foot into the ground as a crippling fire sets him ablaze, as swords clash against him, an inferno of fire spews out at the attackers, engulfing them in hellfire.

Mages are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the leylines of magic that permeates Azeroth, mages cast spells of explo-sive fire, arcing lightning, and subtle deception. Their magic can conjure monsters from other planes of exis-tence, or glimpses the future. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals across continents.

\columnbreak
<div style='margin-top:520px'></div>

### Masters of Time and Space
Students gifted with a keen intellect and unwavering discipline may walk the path of the mage. The arcane magic available to magi is both great and dangerous, and thus is revealed only to the most devoted practitioners. To avoid interference with their spellcasting, mages wear only cloth armor, but arcane shields and enchantments give them additional protection. To keep enemies at bay, mages can summon bursts of fire to incinerate distant targets and cause entire areas to erupt, setting groups of foes ablaze. Masters of ice can command blizzards that tear into flesh and limit movement. Should enemies manage to survive this assault, mages can shrink them into harmless sheep in the blink of an eye.

Powerful magi can even generate enhancements and portals, assisting allies by sharpening their minds and transporting them instantly across the world.

### Scholars of the Arcane
Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the titans, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.

Mages live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other mages, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures that are steeped in magic.

### The Lure of Knowledge
Mages' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a mage is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous mages out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most mages believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

### Creating a Mage
Creating a mage character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?

What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other mages? Perhaps you're simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the face of danger.

#### Quick Build
You can make a mage quickly by following these sugges-tions. First, lntelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity.

## Class Features
As a mage, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per mage level

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPPYV7h.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:0px; width:1200px' />

\pagebreakNum

 - *(a)* a scholar's pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack
 - A spellbook

### Spellcasting
As a student of arcane, you own a spellbook with spells that show the glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 of Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the mage spell list.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the mage spell list. You learn additional mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Mage table.

<div style='margin-top:30px;'></div>


<div align="justify">

> ##### Your Spellbook
> The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you con-duct on your own, as well as intellectual break-throughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell re-corded on a scroll in an evil sorcerer's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.
>
> ***Copying a Spell into the Book.*** When you find a mage spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
>
> Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the mage who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
>
> For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experi-ment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
>
> ***Replacing the Book.*** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.
>
> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. Many mages keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
>
> ***The Book's Appearance.*** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own de-corative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you re-ceived as a gift, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.
</div>

#### Spellbook
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level mage spells of your choice. Your spellbook does not contain your known cantrips.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Mage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of mage spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of mage spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your mage level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example. if you're a 3rd-level mage, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of mage spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memori-zing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your mage spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll.

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
</div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a mage spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your mage spells.

#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
Each time you gain a mage level, you add two mage spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventurers, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the "Your Spellbook" sidebar).

### Magi Tradition
When you reach 2nd level, you choose a magi tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of three areas: Arcane Magi, Fire Magi, or Frost Magi, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPPYV7h.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:0px; width:1200px' />

\pagebreakNum

### Font of Magic
At 2nd level, you tap into the leylines running below all of Azeroth, giving you a reserve of magic within yourself. This reserve is represented by magi points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

#### Magi Points
You have 2 magi points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Magi Points column of the Mage table. You can never have more magi points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent magi points when you finish a long rest.

#### Flexible Casting
You can use your magi points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional magi points. You learn new ways to use your magi points as you gain levels.

***Creating Spell Slots.*** You can transform unexpended magi points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can't create spell slots higher in level than 5th. The created spell slots vanish at the end of a long rest.

##### Creating Spell Slots
| Spell Slot Level | Magi Point Cost |&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|
|:----:|:-------:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1st  | 2 ||||||||||||||
| 2nd  | 3 ||||||||||||||
| 3rd  | 5 ||||||||||||||
| 4th  | 6 ||||||||||||||
| 5th  | 7 |||||||||||||||

***Converting a Spell Slot to Magi Points.*** As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of magi points equal to the slot's level.

### Metamagic
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagics of your choice. You gain another one at 9th and 17th level.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

#### Careful Spell
When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 magi point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw.

#### Distant Spell
When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater. you can spend 1 magi point to double the range of the spell.

When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 magi point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

#### Empowered Spell
When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 magi point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). You must then use the new damage rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

#### Extended Spell
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 magi point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

#### Heightened Spell
When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 magi points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

#### Quickened Spell
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 magi points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

#### Subtle Spell
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 magi point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

#### Twinned Spell
When you cast a spell that can only target one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of magi points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 magi point if the spell is a cantrip).

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2. or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Mysterious Restoration
At 20th level, you regain 4 expended magi points whenever you finish a short rest.

## Magi Specializations
Magi are spellcasters who favor magics involving the cardinal elements of the universe. Students gifted with a keen intellect and unwavering discipline may walk the path of the mage. The magic available to mages is both great and dangerous, and thus is revealed only to the most devoted practitioners.

### Arcane Magi
Mages of the arcane are diviners of secrets, balancing the webb and flow of incredible mystic energies. These practi-tioners push their magical knowledge to its very limits. Those who master this craft are capable of releasing a barrage of unrelenting power upon their enemies.

#### Arcanic Savant
Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

#### Arcane Ward
Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your mage level + your Intelligence modifier.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPPYV7h.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:0px; width:1200px' />

\pagebreakNum

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

While the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb damage. but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell. 

Once you create the ward, you can’t create it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Tempest of Power
Beginning at 6th level, you gain resistance to force and thunder damage. In addition, whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals force or thunder damage, blasts of arcane energy erupts from you. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to take force or thunder damage (choose each time this ability activates) equal to half your mage level.

#### Durable Magic
Starting at 10th level, the magic you channel helps ward off harm. While you maintain concentration on a spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws.

#### Overchannel
At 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. when you cast a mage spell of 5th level or lower (excluding cantrips) that deals damage, you can deal maxi-mum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 psychic damage per level of the spell, immediate-ly after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the force damage per spell level increases by 1d12. 

Damage dealt by this feature ignores your resistances and immunities.

\columnbreak

### Fire Magi
While any worthy mage is an unparalleled expert in the use of magic and heavily dedicated to their craft, those who master the forces of fire tend to be a little more audacious than their peers. These mages take pride, even pleasure in igniting their enemies in wild bursts of flame.

#### Fire Savant
Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.

#### Combustion
Starting at 2nd level, you can unleash the flames that blaze within you. As a bonus action, you magically wreath your-self in swirling fire, as your eyes glow like hot coals. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
 - You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
 - Any creature takes fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier if it hits you with a melee attack from within 5 feet of you or if it touches you.
 - Whenever you roll fire damage on your turn, the roll gains a bonus to equal to your Intelligence modifier.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Blazing Soul
Beginning at 6th level, if you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to draw on the sparks within you. You are instead reduced to 1 hit point, and each creature within 10 feet of you takes fire damage equal to half your mage level + your Intelligence modifier.

If you use this feature while under the effects of your Combustion, this feature instead deals fire damage equal to your mage level + twice your Intelligence modifier, and your Combustion immediately ends. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Empowered Evocation
Starting at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any mage evocation spell you cast.

#### Hot Streak
At 14th level, the blazing energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.

### Frost Magi
Frost mages stand apart from their colleagues, in that their chosen school of magic focuses on maintaining supreme control over the capabilities of their enemies. Mages who command frost perform chilling displays on the battlefield, rendering foes immobile as they bombard them with ice.

#### Frost Savant
Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

#### Sculpt Spells
Starting at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

#### Ice Barrier
Beginning at 6th level, you gain resistance to cold damage. You also gain the ability to defend yourself by momentarily encasing yourself in ice. When you are targeted by an attack roll, you can use your reaction after the attack roll is made but before damage is determined, to reduce the damage by an amount equal to twice your mage level. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Conjured Companion
Starting at 10th level, you add the *conjure elemental* spell to your spellbook, the spell is a mage spell for you. When you cast *conjure elemental*, you are only able to conjure a water elemental and your conjured elemental does not require your concentration.

 - The elemental adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.
 - The elemental gains the *ray of frost* cantrip, using your spell casting ability and level to determine its attack and damage rolls.

#### Icy Veins
At 14th level, you gain nourishment from the frost magic that you wield. When you expend a spell slot to cast a spell that deals cold damage, you regain hit points equal to the spell slot's level + your Intelligence modifier.

## Monk
*To ask why we fight... is to ask why the leaves fall. It is in their nature. Perhaps, there is a better question.
Why do we fight? To protect Home, and Family... To preserve Balance, and bring Harmony.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Chen Stormstout* &nbsp;</div>

Taking a deep breath, an orc clad in loose clothes fastens his footings. As the first charging arcs reach him, he ex-hales a cone of fire from his mouth, engulfing his foes.

A gnome standing behind her allies as attacks clash down upon them. She focuses her chi, manifesting a statue of pure jade, as she sends a beam of chi towards her ally, soothing their wounds.

A tauren springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of gnolls on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.

Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

### The Flow of Chi
Monks make careful study of the magical energy they call chi. The pandaren word for 'spirit', they use the energy of their inner spirit, that flows through every living body. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabili-ties. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes, as they gain experi-ence, their training and their mastery of chi gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.

### Training and Asceticism
Small walled cloisters dot the world,  tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn't be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.

Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or other mortal or divine power.

The majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.

For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifes to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.

### Creating a Monk
As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery's threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?

Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Arc you eager to return to your home? As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness chi, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.

#### Quick Build
You can make a monk quickly by following these sugges-tions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Mistweaving monks make their Wisdom higher than Dexterity).

## Class Features
As a monk, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per monk level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** Light armor
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, shortswords
- **Tools:** Choose one type of artisan's tools or one musical instrument
___
- **Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity
- **Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth

#### Equipment

### Unarmored Defense
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.

### Martial Arts
At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing mail or plate armor or wielding a shield:

 - You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and weapons.
 - You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
 - When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action.

### Chi
Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of chi. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of chi points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Chi Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various chi features. You start knowing four such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, Step of the Wind, and Surging Mist. You learn more chi features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a chi point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended chi back into yourself. You must spend 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your chi points.

Some of your chi features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Chi save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
</div>

#### Fists of Fury
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 chi point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

#### Elusive Dance
You can spend 1 chi point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

#### Step of the Wind
You can spend 1 chi point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

#### Surging Mist
You can spend 1 chi point to heal a nearby ally as a bonus action, choose an ally within 30 feet of you, and heal them for 1 martial arts dice + your Wisdom modifier.

\columnbreak

### Unarmored Movement
Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 5 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

### Monastic Tradition
When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Brewmaster, the Way of the Mistweaver, or the Way of the Windwalker, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th. 11th, and 17th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Stunning Palm
Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of chi in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 chi point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Chi-Empowered Strikes
Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Evasion
At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's frost breath or a *ireball*spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and half damage if you fail.

### Detox
Starting at 7th level, you can use an action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### Mystic Vitality
Beginning at 10th level, your mastery of the chi flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.

### Touch of Karma
At 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction and spend 1 chi point to force the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, all damage done to you is transferred back to the attacker as force damage. On a successful save, you and the target each take half of the damage done as force damage.

Once you have used this feature, you can't use it again until you have finished a long rest.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPPYV7h.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:0px; width:1200px' />

\pagebreakNum

### Timeless Body
At 15th level, your chi sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't he aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

### Touch of Death
Starting at 18th level, when you hit with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 chi points to transfer a deadly stream of chi into their body. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. Taking 7d8 + 20 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Once you have used this feature, you can't use it again until you have finished a long rest.

### Inner Self
At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no chi points remaining, you regain 4 chi points.

## Monastic Traditions
Three traditions of monastic pursuit were common in the monasteries scattered across Pandaria. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, sending out monks to teach their ways throughout Azeroth. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept.

### Way of the Brewmaster
Brewmasters are often quirky, though dangerous when underestimated. They may seem to struggle with balance as they chug their concoctions in the middle of a fight. When an opponent actually manages to land an attack, it’s often unclear how much the brewmaster feels it.

#### Improved Chi Flow
When you choose this monastery at 3rd level, you gain the following Chi based abilities:

***Breath of Fire.*** You take a deep breath, and exhale a cone of fire. As an action, you can spend 1 chi point to exhale a 15-ft cone in front of you, each creature in the area is required to make a Dexterity saving throw, taking your monk level + your Wisdom modifier fire damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one.

When you gain your extra attack at 5th level, breath of fire takes up one of your attacks.

***Redirect Attack.*** When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can spend 1 chi point as a reaction to cause that attack to hit one creature of your choice, other than the attacker, that you can see within 5 feet of you.

#### Fortifying Brew
Starting at 6th level, you can manifest the flow of chi within your body into a protective barrier around you. As an action you can spend 3 chi points to give yourself temporary hit points equal to twice times your monk level + your Consti-tution modifier. The temporary hit points last until you finish your next short or long rest. You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Ironskin Brew
Upon reaching 11th level, when you make an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw and have disadvantage on the roll, you can spend 2 chi points to cancel the disadvan-tage for that roll.

#### High Tolerance
At 17th level, you've become accustomed to the feel of phy-sical pain, and through your chi you have evolved a natural resistance. You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks.

In Addition, you can spend 2 chi points to give yourself resistance towards magical damage except psychic until the beginning of your next turn.

### Way of the Mistweaver
Mistweavers are unique among those who heal, they channel mysterious energy. Those who weave the mists wield the power of life’s essence, using a mixture of preven-tative and restorative spells to mend their allies’ wounds.

#### Gift of Ascension
When you choose this monastery at 3rd level, you can cast the *sanctuary* spell on yourself without requiring a material component. This sanctuary lasts up to 8 hours. Its saving throw equals your Chi save DC. A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to this effect for 1 hour.

Once you've cast the spell this way, you cannot do so again for 1 minute.

#### Soothing Mist
At 3rd level, you have a pool of heaaling chi that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your monk level x 10.

As an action, you can manifest a beam of chi towards a creature within 30 feet of you and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Soothing Mist, expending hit pointss separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on constructs.

#### Mistwalk
Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to transfer through mists. As a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. As part of the same bonus action you can use your soothing mist on a target within range of your new position.

You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Jade Serpent Statue
Upon reaching 11th level, you are able to manifest your chi into a statue of Yu'lon the jade serpent. As an action you can spend 3 chi points, and choose an empty square within 30 feet of you to create the statue. The statue has an AC of 8 + your Wisdom modifier, hit points equal to twice your monk level, and immunity to psychic and poison damage.

When you use your Soothing Mist feature, the jade statue mimics its effect. Choose a target within 60 feet of the statue, the chosen target is healed for half of the hit points restored by your Soothing Mist feature.

This statue lasts for 1 minute, and vanishes prematurely if reduced to 0 hit points.

#### Life Cocoon
At 17th level, you are able to manifest your chi into a life saving cocoon in desperate times.

As a reaction upon an ally dying, you can spend 5 chi points to envelope the target in a cocoon of chi. The target is immediately returned to life and healed for four times your monk level. If you are unable, or unwilling to spend 5 chi points to save your ally. You can instead use Life Cocoon for free, immediately taking 3 levels of exhaustion ass you strain the chi in your body to manifest the cocoon.

Once you have used this feature, either through chi or physical exhaustion, you can't use it again until you have finished a long rest.

### Way of the Windwalker
Among monks, none have mastered the martial arts as the windwalkers have, and few across Azeroth can fight with their grace. Windwalkers possess unparalleled physical finesse, and are capable of overwhelming their enemies with a dizzying flurry of punches and kicks. 

#### Winds Technique
Starting at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy's chi when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Fists of Fury, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:

 - It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
 - It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
 - It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.

#### Windwalking
Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your chi into enhancing your own body. As an action, you can spend 4 chi points to cast the *haste* spell on yourself without providing a material component.

In addition, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to twice your monk level.

#### Step of the Wind
Upon reaching 11th level, you learn to pass through the wind in the blink of an eye. When you take the Attack action, you can teleport up to 10 feet before each attack to an unoccupied space you can see.

If you attack at least two different creatures with the action, you can make one additional attack with it againsst a third creature.

#### Rushing Blows
At 17th level, you gain the ability to make an overwhelming number of attacks against a group of enemies. When you use your Fists of Fury, you can make up to three additional attacks with it (up to a total of five Fists of Fury attacks), providing that each Fists of Fury attack targets a different creature this turn.

## Paladin
*Vengeance cannot be a part of what we must do. If we allow our passions to turn to bloodlust, then we will become as vile as the orcs.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Uther the Lightbringer* &nbsp;</div>

Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.

A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.

Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, a blood elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.

Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by the light to stand against the forces of evil. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.

<br>
<div style='margin-top:505px'></div>

### Paladins Call
This is the call of the paladin: to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish evil from the darkest corners of the world. 
These holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so they can confront the toughest of foes, and the blessing of the Light allows them to heal wounds and, in some cases, even restore life to the dead. Ready to serve, paladins can defend their allies with sword and shield, or they can wield massive two-handed weapons against their enemies. The Light grants paladins additional power against the undead and demons, ensuring that these profane beings corrupt the world no longer.

Paladins are not only zealots, but also guardians of the righteous, and they bestow blessings on those the Light would shine upon. The Light radiates from paladins, and worthy allies who stand near them are emboldened by its power.

### Beyond the Mundane Life
Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.

### Creating a Paladin
The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don't appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the light, justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Or are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow? 

How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from the light while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin's life was your calling.

As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice.

#### Quick Build
You can make a paladin quickly by following these sugges-tions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. (Paladins who strive to please the holy light and heal their allies make Constitution higher than Strength.)

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
 - *(a)* a greatsword or *(b)* any martial weapon
 - *(a)* a priest's pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack
 - Chain mail, shield and a holy symbol

### Divine Sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the demon Illidan Stormrage, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

### Lay on Hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5,

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that crea-ture, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

### Spellcasting
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as
a priest does. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of
spelicasting and chapter 6 of this book for the paladin spell list.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

</div>

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.

### Crusader Strike
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. Crusader Strikes damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.

### Sacred Oath
When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of the Holy, the Oath of Protection, or the Oath of Retribution, all detailed at the end of the class description.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, and 15th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

#### Oath Spells
Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the pala-din spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.

#### Channel Divinity
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.

### Divine Auras
Starting at 3rd level, you are able to emit parts of your divi-nity onto creatures within 10 feet of you. At 3rd level you know one aura of your choice from the list below. When you gain certain paladin levels, you learn additional auras of your choice as shown in the Auras Known column of the Paladin table. Additionally, when you learn a new aura, you can choose one of the auras you know and replace it with another aura from the list. 

Upon reaching 18th level, the range of your auras increase to 30 feet.

You can active a known aura as a bonus action. The aura lasts until you dismiss it using a free action, or until your concentration is broken. You can have multiple auras active at once, each taking a bonus action to active, and sharing a single concentration check.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, regaining expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Aura of Courage
The light stirs the soul of your allies, empowering their courage to keep fighting. You and friendly creatures within range can't be frightened or charmed.

#### Aura of Devotion
Whenever you or a friendly creature within range must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1).

#### Aura of Protection
When a creature within range takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically take that damage, instead of that creature taking it. This feature doesn't transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and this damage can't be reduced in any way.

#### Aura of Resistance
Your divine energy wraps around allies, guarding them from harmful spells. You and friendly creatures within range gain resistance to damage dealt by spells. 

\columnbreak

#### Aura of the Crusader
Whenever you or a friendly creature within range hits with a weapon attack, the creatures attack deals additional fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Improved Crusader Strike
By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Crusader Strike with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Crusader Strike.

### Cleansing Touch
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of one), regaining expend-ed uses when you finish a long rest.

### Avenging Wrath
At 20th level, you may draw upon the empowerment of the light. As a bonus action, you get empowered by the divine energy of the light, sprouting wings of pure light from your back, giving you a fly speed equal to your movement speed. Avenging Wrath lasts for 1 minute, giving you an additional benefit depending on your Sacred Oath.

Once you have used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Holy: Lightbringer
When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

#### Protection: Guardian of Kings
You have resistance to all damage dealt by other creatures, and all allies within 30 feet of you feel the holy lights presence, granting them advantage on death saving throws.

#### Retribution: Divine Judgment
Your Crusader Strike and Improved Crusader Strike deals 1d12 radiant damage instead of 1d8. Additionally, you over-flow with daylight, as if affected by a *Daylight* spell, giving attack rolls against you disadvantage.

## Sacred Oath
Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider—

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.

### Oath of the Holy
Like priests who serve the Light, holy paladins are devout in their faith. Those who pledge themselves to the holy oath becomes beacons of the Light for their allies in conflict, taking up the heavy armor and weaponry of justice.

#### Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

##### Oath of the Holy Spells
| Paladin Level| Spells                           |
|:----:|:-----------------------------------------|
| 3rd  | protection from evil and good, sanctuary |
| 5th  | lesser restoration, zone of truth        |
| 9th  | beacon of hope, revivify                 |
| 13th | death ward, guardian of faith            |
| 17th | holy weapon, mass cure wounds            |

#### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

***Light of Dawn.*** As an action, you present your holy symbol and release a burst of radiant healing that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your paladin level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point max-imum. You can't use this feature on an undead or construct.

***Light's Hammer.*** As an action, you slam a divine maul into the ground at a point within 30 feet of you, causing the ground to erupt in holy light in a 10-ft radius. Any ally within range is healed for twice your paladin level. Any enemy within range must make a Constitution saving throw, taking your paladin level in radiant damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one.

#### Soothing Hand
At 3rd level, you are able to channel the effects of your Lay on Hands over a distance, being able of targeting a creature of up to 30 feets away from you, instead of requiring to touch them.

#### Holy Radiance
Starting at 7th level, holy light flows through your spells for a short distance. Whenever you heal a target within 20 feet of you with a spell, the target gains additional hit points equal to half your paladin level.

#### Beacon of Light
At 15th level, you are able to mark an ally through the holy light. Using a bonus action you mark an ally within 60 feet of you. Whenever you target a creature with a spell that regains hit points, the marked ally is healed for half of the hit points regained. If the marked ally moves beyond 120 feet of you, the bond is broken and the beacon of light ends.

Beacon of Light requires your concentration, and lasts for up to 1 minute. Once you have used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Divine Health
At 3rd level, the holy light flows through your veins, making you immune to diseases.

## Priest
*It is faith in ourselves that separates us from others, and with our powers, we will cause great change in all of Azeroth. The weak will come to lean on you. The lepers will call you Lord. And the ignorant will look to you for guidance.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Dark Cleric Duesten* &nbsp;</div>

Bend down over her falling ally, a dwarf clutches her holy symbol, and begins to sing a slow melodic tune, holy light shining from her hand, covering her allies limp body.

Kneeling on the ground, one hand firmly grasping a staff, the other filled with swirls of divine and necrotic energies. A human raises, and sends out a thick halo of light and dark energy out around him, his allies gaining new life, his enemies feeling the rush of necrotic through their bodies.

A forsaken, surrounded in voidic energy pulls his holy symbol from his neck as void covers his body. Tentacles sprouting from his back, as he sends out a laughter, spew-ing bolts of necrotic energy towards enemies and allies.

Priests are the bridge between light and dark, they are the wielders of the warmth holy light of the divine, and the voidic magic granted by the old gods. They serve as protectors, healers, and casters of insanity.w

### Invokers of Light and Darkness
Priests are devoted to the spiritual, and express their unwavering faith by serving the people. For millennia they have left behind the confines of their temples and the comfort of their shrines so they can support their allies in war-torn lands. In the midst of terrible conflict, no hero questions the value of the priestly orders. These masters of the healing arts keep their companions fighting far beyond their normal capacities with an array of restorative powers and blessings. The divine forces at the priest’s command can also be turned against foes.

<br>
<div style='margin-top:630px'></div>

As light cannot exist without darkness, and darkness without light, some priests tap into shadow to better understand their own abilities, as well as the abilities of those who threaten them.

### Devoted Acolytes
Priests practice a complex, organized form of spirituality built around moral philosophy, the worship of a particular deity (such as Elune) in some cases, and/or idol worship, rather than around the reverence of the elements that shamans practice, or the close divine connection with animals and the wilderness that druids maintain. Priests serve not only as influential religious figures in their respective societies, but also as powerful practitioners of divine magic, which they use to heal and protect, or harm and weaken.

Devotion to the faiths of Azeroth leads many priests to the paths of courage and heroism. In dark times, priests carry the Light of faith with them as a reminder of the powerful forces at work beyond the comprehension of the peoples who walk the land. Powerful healers with an intimate connection to the divine, priests are empowered with abilities that aid them in times of dire need.

### Creating a Priest
Like paladins, the most important aspect of a priest charac-ter is the nature of their holy quest. Are you a devoted ser-vant of good, loyal to the holy light?, a disciplined priest, in beautiful robes, monitoring a sept? or are you an unholy priest of shadows, fallen either by choice or forcefully towards the necrotic arts?

How did you enter priesthood? Were you raised in a mo-nastry? Did you hear a whisper from the light itself telling you to serve it? Or did a terrible war force you to take up the warmth of the holy light to assist your allies? Perhaps you might have known from your earliest memories that the priest's life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.

As guardians against forces of wickedness and evil, priests are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and soothing, or did you never feel the warmth of the holy light, and instead felt the calling of the old gods? their voidic magic wrapping around you, making your actions chaotic?

### Spellcasting
As a conduit for divine power. you can cast priest spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the priest spell list.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the priest spell list. You learn additional priest cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Priest table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Priest table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of priest spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the priest spell list. When you do so, choose a number of priest spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your priest level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level priest, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *flash heal*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of priest spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your priest spells. The power of your spells comes from the light. You use your Wisdom whenever a priest spell refers to your spell-casting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a priest spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

</div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a priest spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your priest spells.

### Priesthood
Choose a priesthood: Discipline, Holy, or Shadow. Each priesthood is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

#### Priesthood Spells
Each priesthood has a list of spells that you gain at the priest levels noted in the priesthood description. 

\columnbreak

<br>

Once you gain a priesthood spell, you always have it pre-pared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a priesthood spell that doesn't appear on the priest spell list, the spell is considered a priest spell for you.

### Unarmored Defense
While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

### Channel Divinity
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from the holy light, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Shackle Undead and an effect determined by your priesthood.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your priest spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

#### Channel Divinity: Shackle Undead
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is shackled for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A shackled creature is considered restrained and stunned until the shackles are broken. While shackled an undead can make a new saving throw at the end of its turn to end the stunned effect on itself. The restrained condition can only be broken if the undead takes any damage, or 1 minute passes.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Destroy Undead
Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Shackle Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.

##### Destroy Undead
| Priest Level | Destroys Undead of CR . . . |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 5th  | 1/2 or lower |
| 8th  | 1 or lower   |
| 11th | 2 or lower   |
| 14th | 3 or lower   |
| 17th | 4 or lower   |

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPPYV7h.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:0px; width:1200px' />

\pagebreakNum

### Divine Intervention
Beginning at 10th level, you can call on the Holy Light to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring its aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your priest level, the Holy Light intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any priest spell or priesthood spell would be appropriate.

If it intervene, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

## Priesthood
As a priest, you choose one aspect of priesthood to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that purpose. Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to branch of priesthood. Your choice of priest-hood could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the purpose that appeals to you most.

### Discipline Priesthood
These priests understand that light casts a shadow, that darkness is defined by light, and that true discipline stems from one’s ability to balance these opposing powers in services of a greater cause. While they poss many holy virtues to aid their allies, they also dabble in the dark arts to debilitate their enemies.

##### Discipline Priesthood Spells
| Priest Level | Spells               |
|:---:|:------------------------------|
| 1st | cure wounds, inflict wounds   |
| 3rd | darkness, spiritual weapon    |
| 5th | animate dead, vampiric touch  |
| 7th | death ward, guardian of faith |
| 9th | contagion, raise dead         |

#### Shadow Mending
When you choose this priesthood at 1st level, you are able to manipulate shadow magic into aiding allies. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 hit points, you instead use the highest number possible for each die rolled.

In addition, you learn the *spare the dying* cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of priest cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet, and you can cast it as a bonus action.

#### Channel Divinity: Halo
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to burst out an expanding ring of radiant and necrotic force.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke a ring of energy that can heal your allies and harm your enemies for a number of hit points equal to four times your priest level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them, choosing for each target if you wish to restore hit points, or deal necrotic damage to them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature to heal an undead or construct.

#### Channel Divinity: Atonement
Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to atone an ally, amending their failure.

When a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant that creature a +10 bonus to the roll. You can use this feature after you see the attack roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses its target.

#### Potent Spellcasting
Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any priest cantrip.

#### Pain Suppression
Upon reaching 17th level, you gain resistance to two damage types of your choice, choosing from bludgeoning, necrotic, piercing, radiant, and slashing. Whenever you finish a short or long rests, you can change the damage types you chose.

As an action, you can give up this resistance and transfer it to one creature you touch. The creature keeps the resis-tance until the end of your next short or long rest or until you transfer it back to yourself as a bonus action.

### Holy Priesthood
These priests leave their houses of worship to serve on the battlefield, as shepherd to flock. There, they use their holy powers to bless allies and mend wounds. Whilst most stay behind the frontlines to aid their comrades, these holy champions are also capable of smiting foes and carrying out sacred justice.

##### Holy Priesthood Spells
| Priest Level | Spells                      |
|:---:|:-------------------------------------|
| 1st | bless, cure wounds                   |
| 3rd | lesser restoration, spiritual weapon |
| 5th | beacon of hope, revivify             |
| 7th | death ward, guardian of faith        |
| 9th | mass cure wounds, raise dead         |

#### Bonus Cantrip
When you choose this priesthood at 1st level, you gain the *virtue* cantrip if you don't already know it.

#### Echoes of Life
At 1st level, whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.

#### Channel Divinity: Prayer of Healing
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal those that are badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer, evoking healing energy. Choose any creature within 30 feet of you, healing each creature for a number of hit points equal to your priest level + your Wisdom modifier. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.

#### Blessed Healer
Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others can heal you as well. When you cast a spell with a spell slot and it restores hit points to any creature other than you this turn, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPPYV7h.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:0px; width:1200px' />

\pagebreakNum

#### Leap of Faith
Starting at 8th level, you can use holy energy to pull a target towards you. As a bonus action, choose a creature within 60 feet of you, pulling the creature to an empty square within 5 feet of you, doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity on the pulled target. A creature can make a Strength saving throw to prevent being pulled to your side. On a successful save, the creature isn't pulled towards you.

You can use this feature twice. You regain expended usses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Guardian Spirit
Upon reaching 17th level, you can call upon a guardian to immediately guide a fallen allies spirit back to their body.

As a reaction upon an ally dying, you can call upon a guardian spirit, immediately resurrecting the ally, and heal-ing them for twice your priest level. The resurrected ally gains immunity towards all damage until the beginning of their next turn.

Once you have used this feature, you can't use it again until you have finished a long rest.

### Shadow Priesthood 
These priests fully embrace the void and its magics, their faith equal to their holy counterparts, yet focused on dark magics and mental manipulation. They dedicate their lives to worship, but they derive their power from the Void, stray-ing dangerously close to the domain of the Old Gods.

##### Shadow Priesthood Spells
| Priest Level | Spells                   |
|:---:|:----------------------------------|
| 1st | arms of hadar, hex                |
| 3rd | mind blast, phantasmal force      |
| 5th | fear, hunger of hadar             |
| 7th | black Tentacle, phantasmal Killer |
| 9th | negative energy flood, wall of Force |

#### Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this priesthood at 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.

#### Legacy of the Void
Also at 1st level, learn one necromancy cantrip of your choice from any spell list. When you cast a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other.

\columnbreak

#### Channel Divinity: Submit to Madness
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to surrender to the madness of the Old Gods.

As an action, you invoke your holy symbol with necrotic energy, covering your body in void. For the duration of the channel divinity, you add twice your Wisdom modifier to your Armor Class, and you use your reaction to give attacks roll against you disadvantage, shifting your voidic shape.

In addition, when you would normally roll one or more dice to damage a target with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of dealing 2d6 hit points, you damage the creature for 12.

This channel divinity lasts for 1 minute, and does not require your concentration. When the channel divinity ends, you must make a Constitution saving throw against your own spell save DC. Taking half your maximum health in psychic damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one. This damage ignores temporary hit points, resistances and im-munities. If the damage brings you below 0 hit points, you immediately become stable.

#### Unseen Recovery
Beginning at 6th level, you start to feel the influence of the old gods. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your priest level (rounded up), and non of the slots can be of 6th level or higher.

For example, if you're a 4th-level priest, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot, or two 1st-level spell slots.

#### Shadowy Embrace
Starting at 8th level, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced. You have spent so much time dealing with shadow magic and meddling with the void that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.

#### Improved Legacy of the Void
Upon reaching 17th level, when you cast a necromancy spell of 1st through 5th-level that targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its mate-rial components, you must provide them for each target.

## Rogue
*You're gonna find a number of outfits that covet our skills. Adventurers, SI:7... heck, even the disorganized rabble wouldn't mind a spy or two inside Stormwind. But you remember this: You're your own man. Don't let nobody bully you into doing something you don't wanna do! Besides, we hold all the cards... at least, we do before the game's done.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Jorik Kerridan* &nbsp;</div>

Signaling for her companions to wait, a female orc creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools to pick it in the blink of an eye. Before disappearing into the shadows as her warrior friend moves forward to kick the door open.

A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.

Suppressing a giggle, a gnome silently sneaks up behind a guard, lifting the key ring from the his belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.

Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

<br>
<div style='margin-top:430px'></div>

### A Simple Code
For rogues, the only code is the contract, and their honor is purchased in gold. Free from the constraints of a conscience, these mercenaries rely on brutal and efficient tactics. Lethal assassins and masters of stealth, they will approach their marks from behind, piercing a vital organ and vanishing into the shadows before the victim hits the ground. Rogues can dip their weapons in paralyzing toxins that render foes unable to defend themselves. These silent stalkers wear leather armor so they can move unencumbered, ensuring that they land the first strike.

With the rogue’s poisons and speed, the first strike is often the last step before the killing blow.

Rogues fend for themselves, looking for fights in which they dictate the terms. They’re the shadows in the night that remain unseen until the right moment comes to strike, then they dispatch an opponent with quick blade work or a deadly toxin snuck acutely into the bloodstream. Rogues are opportunistic thieves, bandits, and assassins, but there’s an unparalleled art to what they do.

### Skill and Precision
Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.

When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.

### Creating a Rogue
As you create your rogue character, consider the charac-ter's relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past, or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves' guild master? or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventurers, or some other desire or ideal?

What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend, who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.

#### Quick Build
You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at Investigation. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't in-capacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

### Thieves' Cant
During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

### Cunning Action
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

### Roguish Specialization
At 3rd level, you choose an area to specialize yourself within, that shapes your rogue abilities: Assassin, Outlaw, or Subtlety, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your specialization choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Uncanny Dodge
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

\columnbreak

### Evasion
At 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an *ice storm* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Reliable Talent
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Blindsense
Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

### Slippery Mind
By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

### Elusive
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

### Stroke of Luck
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively. if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Roguish Specialization
Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directi-ons, embodied by the rogue specializations. Your choice of specialization is a reflection of your preferred techniques. 

### Assassin
You focus your training on the grim art of death. Favoring stealth and vicious poisons over direct approaches. Those who adhere to this specialization are diverse: hired killers, spies, and bounty hunters. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your foes with deadly efficiency.

#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.

#### Assassin's Intuition
Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

#### Elaborate Planning
Beginning at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false iden-tities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an iden-tity. You can't establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.

Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.

#### Ambush Master
Starting at 13th level, you excel at leading ambushes and acting first in a fight.

You have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the first creature you hit during the first round of a combat becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls against that target have advantage until the start of your next turn.

#### Seal Fate
At 17th level, you have become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dex-terity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.

### Outlaw
You hone your skills in larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, pirates, and other criminals typically follow this specializa-tion, but so do rogues who prefer to not fight fair, using dirty tricks to gain the upper hand in combat. These rogues care little for tactics or discretion, and happily engages in a brawl head on.

#### Firearm Intrigue
When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with firearms.

#### Hit and Run
At 3rd level, you learn how to land a strike and slip away without reprisal. During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make oppor-tunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.

You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.

#### Quick Combatant
Starting at 9th level, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. If you have a climbing or swimming speed, this in-crease applies to that speed as well.

#### Misdirection
Starting at 13th level, you can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When you are targeted by an attack while a creature is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to have the attack target that creature instead of you.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier, regaining uses after a short or long rest.

\columnbreak

#### Adrenaline Rush
At 17th level, the rush of battle runs to your head. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your se-cond turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.

### Subtlety
Subtlety rogues are the masters of the shadows, and they strike unseen. They don’t have the lethal strikes of the assassin or the brawling prowess of the outlaw, but their ability to hide in plain sight are unrivaled, performing devastating strikes, and slipping away to strike again. 

#### Shadowstep
When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you delve into shadow magics, giving you an unexpected advantage over most. When you use your cunning Action to Dash or Disengage, you can choose to instead teleport to an un-occupied square that you can see within the range of your remaining movement. Creatures within 5 feet of you still get attacks of opportunity when you take the dash action, but attack rolls are made with disadvantage.

At 3rd level, you can use this feature once between short or long rests. You gain an additional use of Shadowstep when you reach 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

#### Vision of the Night
At 3rd level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. <br>If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.

You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on dark-vision. While in darkness, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness.

#### Supreme Sneak
Beginning at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

#### Cloak of Shadow
Starting at 13th level, you are able to dodge in unforeseen ways, briefly shrouding yourself in supernatural shadowy. Whenever a creature makes an attack roll against you and doesn't have advantage on the roll, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on it. You must use this feature before you know the outcome of the attack roll.

#### Veil of Deceit
At 17th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts by succeeding on a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the mind reader's Wisdom (Insight) check.

Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic.

## Shaman
*The wolves are not tamed, not as you might understand the word. They have come to be our friends because I invited them. It is a part of being a shaman. We have a bond with the things of the natural world, and strive always to work in harmony with them. Warlocks would term them spells, but we shamans simply term them calls. We ask, the powers we work with answer. Or not, as they will. I can call the snows, and wind, and lightning. The trees may bend to me when I ask. The rivers may flow where I ask them to.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Drek'Thar of the Frostwolf clan* &nbsp;</div>

An orc clad in loose plates chained together stands atop a lonely peak, as the winds pick up around him, slowly lifting the heavy metal plates from his body, before releas-ing a glistering bolt of lightning towards his enemies.

A gray haired dwarf slowly lumps his way across the battlefield, emptying a bottle of water into the earth as he walks, before lifting it from the soil, and gently waves it over the body of a wounded ally, soothing his grave wounds.

A human sprinting through the thicket, a pair of massive wolves of spectral vision running at his side. In the flash of a moment he howls as his body turns into a wolf of similar visage to his pets.

Shaman are mortal mediators between the very elements themselves. Often spiritual guides of their com-munities, these powerful practitioners commune with the ancestors and seek to balance the raging elemental forces, and can call upon them in battle to scorch and blast their enemies, or to strengthen and heal their allies. Shaman can enhance their weapons with elemental effects, smite enemies with lightning strikes and bursts of lava, and summon powerful elementals to their aid.

<br>
<div style='margin-top:538px'></div>

### Calling of the Elements
Shamans are unique in their way of casting spells, whilst a warlock would bend the energy to their will to perform their spell, a shaman calls upon the elements themselves, and the elements may respond, or choose not to. They com-mune with forces that are not strictly benevolent. The ele-ments are chaotic, and left to their own devices, they rage against one another in an unending primal fury. It is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos, acting as moderators amongst them.

These masters of the elements can also call upon ele-mental forces directly, unleashing torrents of lava and bolts of lightning against foes. The elements can create, destroy, support, and hinder. An experienced shaman balances the vast spectrum of these primordial forces into an array of diverse abilities, making shaman versatile adventurers and valued members of any group.

### Respected and Feared
Since the primitive tribal cultures of Azeroth and Draenor, the elements of the physical universe have been celebrated, feared, and even worshiped. Mystics sought communion with the earth, air, fire, and water, and learned to tap into their raw power. In time, these spiritual guides came to understand that nature’s elemental forces aren’t wholly benevolent, but have, in fact, been locked in an unending conflict of chaos and primal fury that once consumed the physical realm. So began the calling of the Shaman, to bring balance to these volatile energies, leveraging their intensity to mend wounds . . . or inflict them.

### Creating a Shaman
When creating an elemental shaman, consider how the elements affect your personality. Although elemental shaman have resonance with all four primary elements, some tend to outwardly display aspects of one over the others. Those leaning towards fire might be impatient, temperamental, or full of energy in everything they do. Water leaning shaman are adaptable, chaotic, and tend to go with the flow. Those who favor earth are typically lawful, stalwart, and stubborn. Shaman who favor air are aloof, distant, and typically the most neutral in arbitrations. 

Think about your bond with your totems and how they represent the elemental planes from which you gain your power. Are they simply tools to you for channelling raw planar power, or are they sacred and worthy of reverence? Do they act as representations of a favored element or do you use them to keep a favored element in check? How a shaman perceives their connection to the elemental planes should be reflected in the totems they summon forth.

#### Quick Build
You can make a shaman quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. If you intend to engage in melee combat regularly, make Strength your second highest ability score instead.

### Spellcasting
As a link between the elements. you can cast shaman spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the shaman spell list.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the shaman spell list. You learn additional shaman cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Shaman table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Shaman table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of shaman spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the shaman spell list. When you do so, choose a number of shaman spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your shaman level (minimum of 1 spell) The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 4th-level shaman, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include seven spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *absorb element*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of shaman spells requires time spent communing with the elements: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your shaman spells. The power of your spells comes from the elements and spirits. You use your Wisdom whenever a shaman spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a shaman spell and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the totems you know and replace it with another totem that you could have learnt at that level.

#### Binding Spells
Each binding has a list of spells that you gain at the sha-man levels noted in the binding description. Once you gain a binding spell, it is always prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day

You can stay as your spirit animal for 1 hour. You then revert back to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, die, or make an attack or cast a spell that affects an enemy creature.

## Warlock
*Imagine what you could do if you led a group of shaman who controlled the source of their powers, instead of begging and scraping for it. Imagine if these shaman had servants who could also fight on your side. Servants who could send your enemies fleeing helplessly in terror. Suck their magic dry as the insects in the summer suck blood.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Gul'dan* &nbsp;</div>

An imp skitters behind her as a young human clad in robes smiles warmly, weaving magical charms into her honeyed words, bending the palace sentinels to her will.

A brutish orc waves his hand in the air, sparking flames of green and red, with a flash of his hand, he hurls a ball of fel infused fire against a night elf.

Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the rough drawn glyphs made in the dirt. A wild eyed forsaken begins a slow chant, as a demonic gate erupts from the ground.

Warlocks and seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through their powerful fel magic and secret grimoire, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. They draw on powers often forbidden throughout Azeroth to bolster their own power.

### Dark Arts, Dominance
In the face of demonic powers, most adventurers see death and destruction. Warlocks see only opportunity, dominance is their aim, and have found a path to it in their shadow magic. These voracious spellcasters enslave demon as their minions to fight and protect besides them. The power of their enslaved demons strengthens as the warlock does, making them able to summon deadly demons to their aid.

<br>
<div style='margin-top:484px'></div>

### Wielders of Fel
warlocks are the wielders of the destructive fel magic, a form of magic often used by demons and members of the Burning Legion. It is a form of magic that is demonic, entropic, and extremely chaotic. Its practice has been banned throughout most regions of Azeroth, and is not something even warlocks dare practice openly, yet it is still practiced by most warlocks in secrecy.

Whilst other forms of magic comes as a natural source from the wielder or is granted by the spirits, fel magic is a bargain, it corrupts the minds of those surrounded and affected by it, and desecrates the land it touches. If their demonic companion was not enough to frighten common folks of Azeroth, the knowledge of the fel powers they wield are enough to discourage service to them.

### Delvers of Secrets
Warlocks are the most volatile and insatiable of spell-casters. Though they often pledge themselves to the service of noble causes and are not innately evil, their desire to understand darker magics and exercise unwavering command over demonic forces breeds mistrust among even their closest allies. Warlocks peer into the Void without hesitation, leveraging the chaos they glimpse within to devastating ends in battle—their greatest abilities are fueled by the souls they’ve harvested from their victims. 

They exploit powerful shadow and fel magic to manipu-late and degrade the minds and bodies of their enemies. They employ hellish fires to rain from the skies, immolating their opponents. summoning and commanding indomitable demons from the Twisting Nether to do their bidding, or even to be sacrificed as the Warlock sees fit, empowering and protecting the dark caster from harm.

### Sworn and Beholden
A warlock is defined by a pact, a secretive grimoire given to them, granting them knowledge hidden to the world. A warlock might be a new found member of one of Azeroth's many cults hidden in ruins no longer used, their grimoire given to them by the cults leader. More often, though, the adventurer found or sought out a grimoire on their own. 

The boons bestowed on a warlock through their grimoire ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being, to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat.

### Creating a Warlock
As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about you got a hold of a grimoire and the obligations that your book imposes upon you. What led you to become a warlock and acquire a grimoire? Were you seduced by the powers that fel magic can promise, or did you seek out a warlocks ritual that would entice you to study their ways. Did you search for knowledge and found more than you expected?

Your newfound grimoire might have driven you into adventurers, seeking out knowledge about its secrets to empower yourself further.

If you loose your grimoire, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a new one from the twisting nether.

### Shadow Magic
Your research of shadow and its devastating magic have given you facility with spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for for the warlock spell list.

#### Cantrips
You know three cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

#### Spell Slots
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example. when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell *inflict wounds*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

#### Spell Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

</div>

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

\columnbreak

### Life Tap
Starting at 2nd level, you are able to sacrifice your own life force to restore part of your shadow magic. As a bonus action, you can deal 1d6 necrotic damage to yourself to re-plenish a spell slots. Whenever your spell level increases, Life Drain deals an additional 1d6 necrotic damage to you.

### Demon Companion
When you reach  3rd level, you uncover a ritual making you able to summon an unwilling demon from the twisting nether to the material plane and binding it to your will.

Summoning a demon takes an hour, at the end of which the summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of you. You can summon any demon with a challenge rating lower than half your warlock level rounded up (minimum of one). You are only able to have one demon enslaved at a time, summoning additional demons while you have one enslaved will break your enslaved demons chains, making it hostile towards you.

Your demon obeys your commands as best it can, acting on your initiative count, its actions, decisions, attitude and so on determined by you. If you are incapacitated or absent, the companion acts on its own. Whilst enslaved, your demon can't do any actions that would go against your alignment. For example, if you are a good aligned warlock, your demon can't on its own accord begin to wreak havoc around you, its enslavement forbids it and prevents it from taking such actions without explicit order to do so.

You can dismiss the demon permanently any time you choose, using a minute, or you can temporarily dismiss it into a pocket dimension, while in this dimension the demon regains hit points as if it had finished a long rest. You can recall your demon from the pocket dimension, also using a minute, making it reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

If your demon companion dies while enslaved to you, you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 12 + the CR of the summoned demon). Taking 1d10 psychic damage for each CR the demon had, and half the damage on a successful one. This damage ignores temporary hit points, resistances and immunities, and reduced your hit point maximum by an amount equal to the damage dealt.

## Grimoire
Warlocks are granted a grimoire for their dedication towards a certain aspect of warlocks. Three grimoires exist, each delving into a different aspect of the powers warlocks wield.

### Grimoire of Affliction
Warlocks of the affliction grimoire are masters of shadow-touched powers, unlike the shadow priests these warlock delight in using fel as a force to cause intense pain and suffering in others.

#### Nether Ward
Starting at 10th level, your meddling with the twisting nether has taught you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.

#### Seed of Corruption
At 14th level, you unarmed strikes count as magical and deal necrotic damage instead of bludgeoning, using your spell attack modifier for attack and damage rolls.

The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC as the corruption quickly spreads through its body. On a failed save, the target takes 8d10 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

Additionally, if the target fails the saving throw, you can use an action on subsequent turns to issue it a single command, as if you were casting the *command* spell. The target makes its saving throw against your command with disadvantage. You can issue this command at any time while the target remains infected. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, at which point the target is cured of the corruption. The infection can also be removed with a lesser restoration spell.

### Grimoire of Demonology
Warlocks of the demonology grimoire have mastered harnessing the power of the malefic demon beings on the field of battle. While their practice is often considered by outsiders as wicked and reckless, the demonologist maintains absolute control over their enslaved creatures.

The imp is summoned in an unoccupied square within 15 feet of you, and follows the same rules as your Demon Companion feature, with the exception of dealing damage to you upon death.

You can have a number of wild imps under your control equal to your warlock spell level. For example, a 5th level warlock would be able to have three wild imps under his control.

A wild imp stays for up to 10 minutes before being sucked back into the twisting nether, until you dismiss them as an action, or until they die.

 - A summoned demon gains an increase to its hit point maximum equal to twice your Warlock level.

\columnbreak

### Grimoire of Destruction
Warlocks of the destruction grimoire are well-versed in discharging a dizzying array of shadow, fel, fire, and chaos magics upon opponents that rattle souls and conflagrate bodies.

#### Demonic Refuge
Beginning at 6th level, you have learnt secrets of the twist-ing nether, using it as a refuge in dire times. As an action, you disappear from the world for a brief moment and enter the Twisting Nether, taking advantage of its timeless space. While in your demonic refuge, you can take two actions to cast spells that target only you. After using those actions, you return to the space you occupied and your turn ends.

#### Twisted Fortitude

## Warrior
*Now, watch them attack me. Pitiful! Do they think to take vengeance for their fallen? Do they come to challenge ME? I, who have won a hundred wars? I, who stood alone against thousands and still shouted for my enemies to come? No, these saurok will crumple before me like paper before the flame!*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Skeer the Bloodseeker* &nbsp;</div>

A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield high before her as she charges toward the massed kobolds. A night elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the kobolds with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The dwarf nearby shouts orders, helping
the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.

An orc in chainmail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and his companion in a swift action, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a blood elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.

A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd's delight, and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.

### Ancient Practice
For as long as war has raged, heroes from every race have aimed to master the art of battle. Warriors combine strength, leadership, and a vast knowledge of arms and armor to wreak havoc in glorious combat. Some protect from the front lines with shields, locking down enemies while allies support the warrior from behind with spell and bow. Others forgo the shield and unleash their rage at the closest threat with a variety of deadly weapons. 

<br>
<div style='margin-top:570px'></div>

The warrior’s battle cries embolden friends and leave foes cowering in fear. With legendary precision, warriors target the smallest gaps in armor and slice at hamstrings in a blur of steel.

Every dragon slain, corrupted tyrant toppled, and demon banished from Azeroth has trembled in the face of these lords of war.

Warriors are the quintessential fearless fighters on the battlefield, and their pure martial prowess inspires courage in allies and despair in enemies. Experts in all manner of melee weaponry and possessing incredible physical strength and skill, Warriors are perfectly suited to serve as frontline combatants and battlefield commanders.

### Well-Rounded Specialists
Warriors learn the basics of all combat styles. Every warrior can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a warrior is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on protection their allies from mortal blows, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some prefer a single large weapon able to be wielded with extraordinary force. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.

### Creating a Warrior
As you build your warrior, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane fighters around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might ail have been factors.

You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms. or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death's embrace.

#### Quick Build
You can make a warrior quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.

## Martial Stances
Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial stance you choose to emulate reflects your approach.

### Arms
As a childhood of sparring defines a warrior’s destiny, so too does one’s choice of weapon determine their role on the battlefield. Arms warriors gravitate toward two-handed weapons instinctively. Two-handed weapons allow them to deliver devastating, overpowering blows, fully exploiting their enemies’ weaknesses.

#### Improved Critical

#### Seasoned Soldier

\pagebreakNum

### Fury
On the battlefield and in the arena, the most feared combat-ants are often the furious berserkers who lust for battle and thirst for blood. Through a lifetime of training and sparring, these merciless warriors have become masters of carnage.

#### Rage
Beginning when you choose this stance at 3rd level, you fight with an unparalleled bloodthirst. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits:

 - You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
 - You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
 - You can make a single weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns. 

<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

If you are able to cast spells, you cannot cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

You can rage a number of times equal to your Constitu-tion modifier (minimum of one), regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Trance of Battle

#### Intimidating Shout
Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

#### Into The Fray
Upon reaching 15th level, creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.

\columnbreak

#### Enraged Regeneration
At 18th level, the bloodthirst that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows.

While you're raging, having 0 hit points doesn't knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.

### Protection
Like their counterparts, protection warriors are virtually bred for physical dominance, having been raised in the art of close-quarters combat. They demonstrate an uncanny knack for the use of a shield, nullifying an opponent’s advances and creating opportunities for counterattacks.

#### Rallying Cry
Beginning when you choose this stance at 3rd level, when you use your Second Wind feature, you can choose up to three creatures within 60 feet of you that are allied with you. Each one regains hit points equal to your fighter level, provided that the creature can see or hear you.

#### Intercept
Starting at 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you're wielding a melee weapon or a shield . Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### Never Surrender
Beginning at 10th level, you are able to use your second wind feature twice between short or long rests.

#### Leave No Man Behind
Starting at 15th level, when you decide to use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.

#### Last Stand
At 18th level, if you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points and doesn't kill you outright, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious and immediately take an extra turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

# Prestige Classes
Prestige classes offer players a way to delve into uniqie class options, classes that are not so easily taught or learnt. The Death Knight requires the aid of the powerful Val'kyr, and a personal sacrifice to be made, a sacrifice of blood, and the Demon Hunter, Illidan's elite soldiers, requires more than a simple blood sacrifice, it requires cunning actions to be taken, personal scars to be made that will last the characters life.

Both classes are powerful in their own ways, and both will grant the individual features unique to them. They each require the player to complete special tasks, a brief description of the tasks are presented in the class Prerequisites. For a more indepth look of what must be done, see Appendix B at the end of this book.

### Joining a Prestige Class
In order to join a prestige class, you must first check with your Dungeon Master. A DM can opt to include or disallow prestige classes in their game. Prestige classes require you to undertake specific actions in the game so that your character can begin pursuing that class. If those actions aren't alreaady possible in your campaign, talk to your DM about integrating the prestige class that interests you.

A prestige class uses the normal rules for multiclassing (See chapter 5, "Customization Options," later in this book). When your character is ready to advance a level, you can choose to gain a level in a prestige class. Your levels in all your classes, including prestige classes, are added together to determine your character level.

#### Prerequisites
Taking up a prestige class through multiclassing involves meeting certain prerequisites, just as with multiclassing into a standard class. You must meet the ability score prerequisites for your current class and for the prestige class in order to qualify for it.

<div style='margin-top:50px;'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A prestige class requires a minimum character level and a minimum score in at least one ability, as well as requiring that you complete a specific deed before being able to take up that class.

#### Experience Points
Just as with the standard rules for multiclassing, the experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class.

#### Hit Points and Hit Dice
Each prestige class specifies the hit points you gain from it. You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes and prestige classes to determine your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you pool them together.

#### Proficiency Bonus and Proficiencies
Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. A prestige class specifies whether it grants proficiencies when you enter it.

#### Prestige Class Features
You gain prestige class features just like normal class features. Sometimes, a prestige class can improve features you have gained from other classes. If a prestige class grants Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, or Unarmored Defense, that feature is treated the same way as if you had gained it from multiple standard classes.

#### Spellcasting
The Death Knight prestige class grants spellcasting. It provides details on how to determine your overall spellcasting ability, using the rules for spellcasting and multiclass character.

## Death Knight
*A hero... that's what you once were. You stood against the shadow, and purchased another dawn for this world at the cost of your life. But the evil you fought is not so easily banished, the victory you claimed not so easily held. The specter of death looms over this world again, it has found new champions to bring about its final reign. Knights of darkness, this is the hour of your dark rebirth . . .*

<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— A knight of the Ebon Blade* &nbsp;</div>

A human clad in heavy armor, wielding a greatsword with both hands, as he clutches it close, runes flash along its edge, leaving a stream of black smoke behind his swings.

An orc surrounded by kobolds, forces his axe into the ground as the earth around him wither and die, frightening the kobolds as they run for their life.

Biting cold rushes through the battle, as a lone blood elf walks forward, her armor clad in a layer of frost, she walks with firm steps, freezing the earth beneath her feet.

No matter their past calling, death knights serve the powers of death, wielding weapons infused with runes of power. They are ruthless and practical warriors resurrected by the powerful val'kyrs and granted the powers of the revered death knights of the Ebon Hold. Although these warriors seem dead at a glance, they are very much alive.

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:489px'></div>

### Outcast for Life
Although these death knights are not undead as the genera-tions before them, they carry much of the essence of the knights that came before them, and from a distance have the look of a dead person, their blank white stares peering at the world around them. Even though they are alive and not emotionless, it means little to most they meet who shun them because of what they have become. Death knights are bringers of death and destroy, a fact not easily forgotten.

This has lead most death knights down a solitary path, many keep to the outskirts of towns and cities, or hide their appearance well before entering.

### Grim Revival
Being resurrected as a death knight is not a simple task, only complicated further by the scar it leaves on the newly resurrected, gaining the powers of the death knights weak-ens the soul for a tremendous time, a price that has to be paid. But not only does it drain the death knight, some scars are visible for all to see, their resurrection has filled their body with necrotic energy that will forever linger with-in them, a trait always shown through their eyes, which will forever sit as two white lights in their sockets.

### Steadfast Warriors
Death knights are exceptional warriors, and in many ways similar to paladins, being keen with various weapons and able to fight in any armor, aiding their combat with the use of magic. They wield their empowered runic weapons and shadow magic which enables them to overpower most foes that would dare to stand against them, making them fearful fighters able to stand in any situation.

### Becoming a Death Knight
For most, becoming a death knight was not a choice, the vast majority of death knights was raised by the Lich King and enslaved under his control, very few remain of the death knights that was freed from his control. Because of this very few new death knights are made, as death knights does not wish to give other their fates, living a live without feelings, in constant battle against the Lich King's ever present control. Necromancers cared little for what death knights wanted, and in secret studied incantations and rituals that would make them able to gain the powers of the revered death knights. Eventually they succeed and crafted a dark simulacrum, detailing complex spells that would allow them to gain the powers of a death knight, without the sacrifice of death, and outside the Lich King's control. To this day their efforts has been eliminated and their simulacrum lost to time.

As you choose to use the simulacrum to become a death knight, consider why you decided to undergo the transfor-mation. Did you seek greater power that what was offered in the living world? Were you seeking a means to end the scourge? Perhaps you were simply curious as to the tomes spells and did not know what you were entering? Perhaps you were sick of your previous life, and wished for a new beginning?

Think about what effect the transformation has done to you, becoming a death knight comes at a cost, it splits a fragment of your soul, forever changing part of you, while these death knights are still alive, the resurrection often changes how one acts, if not for the memory of having sacrificed yourself, then the necrotic energy now rushing through your body.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:46px;'></div>

## Prerequisites
In order to undergo the transformation required to advance as a death knight, you must meet the following prerequi-sites (in addition to the multiclassing prerequisites for your existing class):
 - **Strength 13.** Death Knights need to be able to wield weapons and strike hard upon their enemies.
 - **Charisma 13.** Imbued with magic they need to be able to wield the magic within them into spells.
 - **Proficiency in Heavy Armor or Martial Weapons.** Death knights learn much through their training, but some skills has to be known beforehand.
 - **Character Level 5th.** Death knights are made out of the corpses of adventurers, imbued with magic, a simple process but straining for the imbuer, as such you must be a 5th-level character before you can gain levels in the death knight prestige class.
 - **Complete a Special Task.** To become a death knight you must find the dark simulacrum and perform the ritual presented in it. At which point you will be reawaken as a weak death knight. See Appendix B for an indepth of the special task and the dark simulacrum.

## Class Features

\pagebreakNum

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** All armors
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
- **Tools:** None
___
- **Saving Throws:** Strength
- **Skills:** None

#### Equipment
The death knight prestige class does not grant any special equipment.

### Lingering Death
You've been brought back from the dead in an unusual way that drains more of your strength than normal, giving you the following short and long term benefits:

#### Weak Awakening
Upon becoming a death knight, you gain a -4 penalty to your level, but keep your hit point maximum and profici-ency bonus you would've had at that level. Every time you finish a long rest, the level penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears. Each time you 'level up' your hit point maximum does not increase as it normally would when you gain a new level.

Additionally whilst you have a -4 level penalty, you can't cast spells, and have disadvantage on all attacks, ability checks, and saves.

#### Dead Gaze
The magic that brought you back will forever linger in your body, covering your eyes with a dead white glow, giving you 120 feet darkvision, and making you able to see in normal and magical darkness.

#### Lost Radiance
The necrotic energy within your body dominates your spell-casting, twisting divine spells that you cast, changing the damage type of any spell that deals radiant damage to ne-crotic. Talk with your DM about adjusting the spell visually to better implement this change.

### Rune Weapon
You are able to engrave empty runes on a chosen weapon, preparing it for your Runic Empowerments feature and granting

***Ritual Engraving.*** You engrave your weapon over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which, you infuse your weapon with empty runic sockets.

Your weapons power fades when not held by you and its benefits can't be used by anyone other than you. You can engrave two weapons of your choice, any attempts to en-grave a third a weapon fails, unless you first use 1 hour to remove the runic sockets of an engraved weapon.

***Engraved Weapon.*** While wielding your rune weapon, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated and the weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunities to nonmagical attacks.

If your rune weapon is damaged, you can imbue magic into a fragment of the weapon over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. This restores the weapon fully, and destroys any other fragments of the weapon in existence. 

\columnbreak

> ### Variant: Lingering Death
> If you prefer a death knight more true to the World of Warcraft universe, you can add *Undeath* to the *Lingering Death* class feature.
> #### Undeath
> Your body has been raised from the dead and imbued with magic, returning your conscious-ness to it. Because of this you gain the following benefits:
> - You have two creature types: humanoid and undead. You can be affected by a game effect if it works on either of your creature types.
> - You don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests.
> - You age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.
> - You don't fall unconscious upon reaching 0 hit points, but continue to fight on as normal, making death saving throws at the beginning of your turn. 
> - You have resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.
> - You are immune to diseases.
> - You have vulnerability to radiant damage.
> ###
> Use this variant with caution, as it is not perfectly balanced and will make the death knight player stronger than intended.

### Shadow Magic
Your dark resurrection has filled you with necromantic energy making you able to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for for the death knight spell list.

#### Spell Slots
The Death knight table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your death knight spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example. when you are 5th level, you have three 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell *cause fear*, you must spend one of those slots, casting it as a 3rd-level spell.

#### Spell Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the death knight spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Death Knight table shows when you learn more death knight spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. For example, when you reach 5th level, you learn a new death knight spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the death knight spells you know and replace it with another spell from the death knight spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPPYV7h.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:0px; width:1200px' />

\pagebreakNum

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your death knight spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cast death knight spell and when making an attack roll with one

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
</div>

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use your rune weapon as a spellcasting focus for your death knight spells.

### Presence
At 2nd level, you have gained powers in a presence of after-life of your choice: the Blood, Frost, or Unholy presence, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 5th, 9th, and 12th level. 

#### Channel Necromancy
Your presence allows you to channel necrotic energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Necromancy option provid-ed by your presence explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Necromancy, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Necromancy again.

Some Channel Necromancy effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your death knight spell save DC.

Beginning at 8th level, you can use your Channel Necro-mancy twice between rests, and at 13th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest you regain your expended uses.

### Runic Empowerments
In your engraving of your rune weapon, you have unearth-ed runic empowerments, fragments of magic that you can imbue into your rune weapons empty sockets.

At 2nd level, you gain two runic empowerments of your choice. When you gain certain death knight levels, you gain additional empowerments of your choice, as shown in the Empowerments Known column of the Death Knight table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the empowerments you know and replace it with another empowerment that you could have learnt at that level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

\columnbreak

### Undeath Nature
Beginning at 4th level, you can hold your breath indefinitely, and you don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests. You age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.

In addition, you don't fall unconscious upon reaching 0 hit points, but continue to fight on as normal, making death saving throws at the beginning of your turn.

### Death Strikes
By 8th level, you are so suffused with negative energy that all your melee weapon strikes carry necrotic power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 necrotic damage.

### Antimagic Shell
Beginning at 10th level, you can use your bonus action to end one spell on yourself.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of 1). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Master of Death
At 15th level, you bond with your runic weapons, parting with a fraction of your soul to imbue with in them. If you die, you return to life 24 hours after death, as the weapon resurrects you. IF your body is destroyed, you reform with-in 1 mile of the place of your death. If your equipment was destroyed you do not regain it.

If your rune weapon is broken or on another place of existence, you are not resurrected after 24 hours. If your weapon returns to your plane of existence after 24 hours has passed, you do not return to life as the magic of your weapon fades and vanishes.

## Presence
No matter why one decided to become a death knight, they all feel the drawing to greater powers, most of which are shunned or directly forbidden in most of Azeroth. A death knight feels the presence of these powers and chooses to delve deeper into one of them, expanding his view whilst learning arts which most would see as dark magic.

### Blood Presence
Death knights of the blood presence enter delve into the shunned arts of blood magic, bolstering their own defenses by the use of blood from themselves and draining their enemies lifeforce for their own gain.

#### Channel Necromancy
When you take this presence at 2nd level, you gain the following two Channel Necromancy options.

***Dancing Rune Weapon.*** As a bonus action, you can animate your rune weapon, imbuing it with negative energy. For 1 minute, the weapon gains the statistics of a flying sword, its weapon dice changing according to your rune weapon, and its hit points equal to half of your maximum health. The weapon attacks on your initiative, and obeys your commands as best it can.

You can end this effect on your turn as a bonus action, making the weapon fly back to you and fall to the ground in your square. 

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPPYV7h.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:0px; width:1200px' />
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/0Juz7SO.png' style='position:absolute; top:855px; right:380px; width:400px' />

\pagebreakNum

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have an empty hand you can make the weapon return to it instead of falling to the ground.

***Death and Decay.*** As an action, you pierce your rune weapon into the ground, desecrating the area around you. Each enemy creature within a 20-foot radius of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is frightened for 1 minute.

A frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you or the desecrated area, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

#### Death's Caress
Starting at 5th, you can sacrifice your own blood to restore epended spell slots. As a bonus action, you deal 3d6 necro-tic damage to yourself. In return you regain a 3rd-level spell slot. For each spell slot above 3rd, Death's Caress deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to you, to a maximum of 5d6 for a 5th-level spell slot. This damage ignores any temporary hit points you may have.

#### Purgatory
Beginning at 9th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit point, you can use your reaction to have 1 hit point instead and become immune to damage until the beginning of your next turn. You can use this feature once per long rest.

#### Blooddrinker
At 12th level, each time you deal necrotic damage to a creature with death strikes, you gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage done.

### Frost Presence
Death knights of the frost presence walk in the footsteps of those that came before them, using cold and ice in a way only matched by mages to do their bidding. They are excep-tional combatants able to deliver devastating blows.

#### Channel Necromancy
When you take this presence at 2nd level, you gain the following two Channel Necromancy options.

***Empower Rune Weapon.*** As an action, you can imbue the rune weapon you are holding with necrotic energy, using your Channel Necromancy. For 1 minute, you add
your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits dim cold light in a 20-foot radius.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

***Howling Blast.*** As an action, you present your rune weapon, causing a frigid wind to howl past you. Each creature within a 60 feet long and 15 feet wide line from you in a direction you choose must make a Constitution saving throw, on a fail, the target gains one level of exhaus-tion and has disadvantage on attack rolls for 1 minute. 

#### Extra Attack
Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

If you already have an extra attack from another class, you can make an additional attack, whenever you take the Attack action.

\columnbreak

#### Remorseless Winter
Beginning at 9th level, you are always under the effects of an *armor of agathys* spell, gaining temporary hit points equal to your death knight level whenever you finish a short or long rest.

#### Frozen Heart
At 12th level, as an action you can freeze your blood, mak-ing your skin pale as snow for 10 minutes. Making you immune to cold damage, and giving you resistance against fire damage for the duration.

While active, your weapon attacks carry the cold with them, any creature hit by a melee weapon attack must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half on a successful one. Additionally a creature who failed the saving throw has their movement speed halved until the beginning of your next turn.

After freezing your body in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Unholy Presence
Death knights of the unholy presence are shunned by most for their deeds, especially by the Holy Light, they wield ne-crotic energy in a way matched only by warlocks, removing any shred of Holy Light around them as they drain their surroundings of joy and hope.

#### Channel Necromancy
When you take this presence at 2nd level, you gain the following two Channel Necromancy options.

***Control Undead.*** As an action, you target one undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey your commands for the next 24 hours, or until you use this Channel Necromancy option again. An undead whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than your death knight level is immune to this effect.

***Dreadblade.*** When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can use Channel Necromancy to deal extra ne-crotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + twice your death knight level.

### Raise Ghoul
Starting at 5th level, you are able to forcefully return a dead creature you touch to life, raising the creature as an em-powered ghoul under your control.

This spell does not restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking a head, or other vital body parts to effec-tively aid you, the spell automatically fails. The ghoul is under your control until it dies, or you use an action to retract the necrotic energies placed within it. You can only have one raised ally at a time, having to rid yourself of your current ghoul before you can raise another.

Your ghoul obeys your commands as best it can, acting on your initiative, its actions, decisions and so on determined by you. If you are incapacitated or absent, the ghoul acts on its own.

Your ghoul has statistics determined in part by your level. Using your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addi-tion to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, your ally also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.

When raised, your ghoul gains an additional hit die for each death knight level you have, and its maximum hit points increase accordingly.

## Demon Hunter
*The enemy came into our world, desiring to extinguish all life. They slaughtered our loved ones, razed our homes..  our cities. You could not stop them. So you came to me, nothing but rage and determination left, I taught you that what once tormented you could give you power.*

*Now you know, no sacrifice is too great if it brings an end to the Burning Legion*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Illidan Stormrage* &nbsp;</div>

A lone night elf clutching a pair of curved blades, peers to the ground as enemies surround him on all sides, before leaping backwards over the heads of his enemies, swinging his swords at one of them in the process.

A blood elf sprints to the distant aid of her allies, a pair of heavy warglaives in her hands, she releases the fel within, leaving a trail of fel in her path as she rushes in inhumane speed to their aid to jump on the nearest enemy.

A heavily built human standing afar as his allies engage a massive demon, in two swift motions he effortlessly slings his warglaives through the air at the demon, making deep gauges in its hide before returning to his firm grasp.

These hunters have sworn their life to a sacred cause, al-though their motivation may vary, demon hunters are one of Azeroths protectors, these agile hunters carry exceptio-nal skill against the foe they face. They wield both mortal strength and the devastating effects of fel magic, carrying out both with extreme precision

### Feared and Revered
Society often shun demon hunters. Most don't understand the sacrifice that they make, therefore, many choose to become outcasts from their societies. Eyes are commonly turned at them when they wade through towns, most distrust and fear them for what they have become.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:606px;'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though the world are untrusting of demon hunters, it matters not the the hunter themselves, cause they are protectors of the common folk against threats wishing the destruction of Azeroth, and most importantly demon. They are not righteous like paladins that fight for the Holy Light, or selfless like some rogues and warriors. They are the force who battles evil and although shunned by common folk, their aid is appreciated by experienced fighters.

### Power Granted for a Price
Demon hunters are not trained like warriors are, they are created. It is a harsh and incurable process, leaving scars on the individual that will never heal. Most who attempt to undergo the rites to become a demon hunter end up dying from the horrors of what now possess them, or kills them-selves because of what they have seen. 

At its very core of becoming a demon hunter is the con-sumption of a demon's soul in a ceremony, forever binding it to the demon hunter and suppressing it from taking control through magical inscriptions on the hunters skin, infused with fel. Finishing the binding of soul to the demon hunter by burning out their eyes with a magically imbued blade, forever binding the chaotic soul of the demon to the hunter. Other processes are done to create a demon hunter, slowly creating a fully fleshed demon hunter by removing much of who they were in their past lives.

### Becoming a Demon Hunter
As you choose to become a demon hunter, consider why you decided to undergo their deadly rituals. Were your family slaughtered by demons of the burning legion and you seek to avenge them? Did you strive for greater power through fel, and wished to control it? Were you full of rage and anger and wished to put it to use beyond raw strength? perhaps you went through their rituals unwillingly, and by a miracle survived the demons attempts to take control? Think of the demon hunters that put you through the rituals and did the rites on you, your relationship to them, are you angry at them for what they have done? pleased with their accomplishment?

Think about what affect the transformation has done on you, physically as well as mentally. All demon hunters who survive the transformation grows horns, varying for tiny studs to massive horns stretching the length of their head. Some demon hunters grow scales on parts of their body, claws on their hands, or have entire limbs misshapen into a crude limb of a demon being. No demon hunter goes through the rites unchanges, and no two hunters come out with the same mutations, the mutations vary as much as the demon soul which now lives within them. Consider what it has done to your personality. Many demon hunters gains a temper cause of the ferocity of the demon within them, or change personality entirely for better or worse. Think about how the demon bond to you is affected you, if it takes control of your judgement at times, or if you keep it in check at all times.

\columnbreak

### Unarmored Defense
While you are not wearing any armor and wielding a shield, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier.

Some of your chaotic features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Chaos save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
</div>

Your character's name and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you It's worth thinking about how these characteris-tics reflect the character you have in mind.

### Name
Your character's race description includes sample names for members of that race. Put some thought into your name even if you're just picking one from a list, it may be some-thing you will have to keep for a long time.

### Sex
You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture's expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior. As an ex-ample, a male night elf priest defies the traditional gender divisions of blood elf society, which could be a reason for your character to leave that society and venture on Azeroth.

You don't need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. You could play a female presenting herself as a man, a man feeling trapped in a female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male. Your character's sexual orientation is for you to decide.

> ##### Contrasting Characters
> The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting your character apart from every other character. Consider the following two human fighters.
>
> Hailing from Strahnbrad. Cayla Davenport was a brash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father's trade on the streets of Southshore. When she tried to rob the proprietor of the Inn, the Early Oak, he caught her and took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. After the scourge destroyed the inn, necessity forced Cayla into adventure alongside the friends she'd known from her childhood.
>
> Endrik Goodwin grew up on the streets of Stormwind. He used his wits, strength, and agility to carve out his own territory in the city's shanty town. After several years, he attracted the notice of one of the most powerful thieves' guilds in the city, and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite his youth.
>
> Cayla and Endrik are both human and both warriors, possessing similarly high Strength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends.

### Height and Weight
You can decide your character's height and weight, using the information provided in your race description or on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what your character's ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy. A weak but agile character might be thin.

If you want to, you can roll randomly for your character's height and weight using the Random Height and Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier column determines the character's extra height beyond the base height. The same number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight Modifier column determines the character's extra weight beyond the base weight.

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

##### Random Height and Weight 
| Race                 | Base<br>Height | Height<br>Modifier | Base<br>Weight | Weight<br>Modifier |
|:---------------------|:-----|:------|:--------|:------------|
| Blood Elf            | 4'9" | +2d10 | 100 lb. | x (1d4) lb. |
| Draenei, broken      | 5'6" | +2d8  | 155 lb. | x (2d6) lb. |
| Draenei, exodar      | 5'9" | +2d8  | 175 lb. | x (2d6) lb. |
| Dwarf, bronze        | 3'8" | +2d4  | 115 lb. | x (2d6) lb. |
| Dwarf, dark          | 3'7" | +2d4  | 125 lb. | x (2d6) lb. |
| Dwarf, wild          | 4'   | +2d4  | 130 lb. | x (2d6) lb. |
| Forsaken, elf        | 4'7" | +2d10 | 90 lb.  | x (1d4) lb. |
| Forsaken, human      | 4'6" | +2d10 | 100 lb. | x (1d4) lb. |
| Gnome                | 2'7" | +2d4  | 40 lb.  | x 1 lb.     |
| Goblin               | 3'   | +2d4  | 35 lb.  | x 1 lb.     |
| Human                | 4'8" | +2d10 | 110 lb. | x (2d4) lb. |
| Night Elf            | 6'1" | +2d8  | 145 lb. | x (1d6) lb. |
| Orc                  | 5'4" | +2d10 | 160 lb. | x (2d6) lb. |
| Pandaren             | 5'8" | +2d4  | 150 lb. | x (2d6) lb. |
| Tauren               | 6'3" | +2d10 | 200 lb. | x (2d6) lb. |
| Troll, forest        | 5'8" | +2d10 | 150 lb. | x (2d6) lb. |
| Troll, ice           | 5'4" | +2d8  | 175 lb. | x (2d6) lb. |
| Troll, jungle        | 5'3" | +2d8  | 160 lb. | x (2d4) lb. |
| Worgen               | 6'2" | +2d10 | 155 lb. | x (2d6) lb. |

<div style='margin-top:0px;'></div>

For example, as a human, Cayla has a height of 4 feet 8 inches plus 2d10 inches. Her player rolls 2d10 and gets a total of 12, so Cayla stands at 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then the player uses the same roll of 12 and multiplies it by 2d4 pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, an extra 36 pounds (12 x 3) on top of her base 110 pounds for a total of 146 pounds.

### Other Physical Characteristics
You choose your character's age and the color of his and her hair, eyes, skin, and other racial traits. To add a touch of distinctiveness, you might want to give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.

> ##### Character Details
> Consider how the names Cayla Davenport and Endrik Goodwin set these characters apart from each other and reflect their personalities. Cayla is a young woman determined to prove that she's not just a kid any more, and her name makes her sound young and ordinary. Endrik Goodwin comes from a the Stormwind province and carries a name of riches.
>
> Cayla is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring career and has auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin with freckles, and a mole on her right hip. Endrik is a small man, compact and all wiry muscle. He has angular features and high cheekbones, and he always seems in need of a shave. His raven-black hair is thick and full, but his eyes are gray and lifeless, betraying the emptiness of his life and soul.

### Alignment
A typical creature in the world of Warcraft has an align-ment, broadly describing its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitude towards society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Indi-viduals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.

**Lawful good** (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Most paladins, and dwarves are lawful good.

**Neutral good** (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, and most gnomes are neutral good.

**Chaotic good** (CC) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.

**Lawful neutral** (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks, and some mages are lawful neutral.

**Neutral** (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Many humans are neutral.

**Chaotic neutral** (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many warriors, and rogues are chaotic neutral.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:220px;'></div>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Lawful evil** (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. The black dragonflight are lawful evil.

**Neutral evil** (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many goblins, and warlocks are neutral evil.

**Chaotic evil** (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, and gnolls are chaotic evil.

#### Alignment in the Multiverse
For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, orcs, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, these races were giving free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery. 

The evil who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies. Centaurs share a violent temperament, running deep in their blood, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an centaur chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life.

Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A eredar does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn't tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a eredar.

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments, they are **unaligned.** Such a crea-ture is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.

<br>

> ##### Cayla and Endrik: Alignment
> Cayla Davenport is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted and striving to help others where she can. Endrik is lawful evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least professional in his approach to murder.
>
> As an evil character, Endrik is not an ideal adventurer. He began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with heroes when he must and when it's in his own best interests.
>
> In most games, evil adventurers cause problems in groups alongside others who don't share their interests and objectives. Generally, evil alignments are for villains and monsters.

### Languages
Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice.

Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that fits in your campaign. With your DM's permission, you can instead choose a language from the opposite factions Language table, an Exotic Languages table, or the language of druids and rogues.

Some languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Kalimag language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elementals. Creatures that speak different dia-lects of a language can communicate with one another.

### Personal Characteristics
Fleshing out your character's personality —the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique identity— will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your charac-ter's favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.

New backgrounds are presented later in this chapter, see also the Player's Handbook and other sources for the full array of available backgrounds for you to choose from. 

\columnbreak

#### Personality Traits












Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. "I'm smart" is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. "I've read every book in Dalaran" tells you something specific about your character's interests and disposition.

Personality traits might describe the things your char-acter likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character's self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.

A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.

#### Ideals
Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the funda-mental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.

Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most impor-tant thing you strive for?

You can choose any ideals you like, but your character's alignment is a good place to start defining them. The back-ground in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the background than with moral or ethical perspectives.

See also the Player's Handbook and other sources for a full list of available backgrounds to choose from.

#### Bonds
Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character's connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character's motivations and goals.

Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?

Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character's history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures.

#### Flaws
Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character's flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What's the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?

## Hero Points
The actions of a hero often include acts of such a daring nature and chance that it is almost impossible to guarantee a sure outcome. Even though every hero confronts perils in the world of Warcraft, fate is on the side of those who face adversity head on and challenge evil and darkness without fear of death.

A paladin who stands alone against a horde of undead while his companions heal a dying comrade, a rogue who leaps after a precious artifact dropped from a lofty tower balcony, a warrior who throws himself against a vastly superior opponent. . . These are the heroes whose actions inspire stories and legends.

Hero points are rewards for that type of valiant action, these points allow a player to bend the fates in his character's favor, and such power requires more hands-on judgement from a DM than most other rules. Hero points blur the lines of action and allow characters to perform the exceptional and even the impossible.

Hero Points are meant as an alternative to Dungeons & Dragons *Inspiration*, you can use either system, but they are not meant to be played on top of one another.

### Gaining Hero Points
The power given by hero points can be immense, your DM can choose to grant you a hero point for your heroic actions. Some adventurers might never earn a hero point, and even when characters does, there is no guarantee that the player will use it when the right time comes. Your DM will tell you how you can earn a hero point in the game.

You either have a hero point or you don't, you can't stockpile multiple "hero points" for later use. Likewise, you cannot earn a hero point through an action that you spend a hero point on performing.

### Using Hero Points
If you have a hero point, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, cast a spell, saving throw, or when being attacked. Spending your hero point makes the check you were an immediate success.

#### Action Surger
You can expend your hero point to make the next turn yours, out of initiative order. Once you've finished the turn, the initiative goes back to normal, and you return to your place in the initiative count.

#### Physical Fighter
You can expend your hero point when rolling for a weapon attack, treating your attack roll as a successful hit. When done, the player chooses one of the following effects:

**Powerful Blow.** Your weapon attack acts as a Massive Critical Hit, roll the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal, and add your character level to the damage.

\columnbreak

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Mutilate.** Your weapon attack mutilates the target, deal-ing normal weapon damage, and attempts to cut off a limb (if any) of your choice. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 12, or half the damage done. On a failed save, the creature gains one of the following mutilations.

 - ***Arm / Hand.*** You cut off the creatures arm, making it unable to hold two items at once, or cast spells while their remaining arm is carrying an object.
 - ***Leg / Foot.*** You cut off the creatures leg, reducing its movement speed by half, and giving opportunity attacks against it advantage. In addition, the creature can't dash.
 - ***Eye.*** You pierce out the creatures eye, giving it disadvan-tage on Perception checks, and reducing its passive Per-ception by 5. If both eyes are removed, or if the creature only has one, it is considered Blinded. This mutilation has no effect if the damage dealt is bludgeoning.

#### Spell Fighter
You can expend your hero point when you cast a spell, treating your spell attack as a successful hit. When done, the player chooses one of the following effects:

**Power Surge.** Your spell attack acts as a Massive Critical Hit, roll the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal, and add your character level to the damage.

**Precision Spell.** You can choose a number of creatures equal to your spellcasting ability modifier to automatically succeed and fail on a saving throw to resist or negate your spells effect.

#### Defensive
You can expend your hero point when you're being targeted by a spell or attack. When done, the player chooses one of the following effects:

**Dodger.** One attack roll made against you that you can see automatically misses, no matter what was rolled.

**Hardy.** You succeed on your saving throw, and gain the effects of rogues *evasion* until the end of the current turn.

#### Survivor
You can expend your hero point after failing a death saving throw, or when suffering from massive damage. Changing your health to 0 and making you stable.

At the DM's discretion you may suffer some signature injury (A scar, lost eye, a limp, and so on) befitting the circumstances, as a reminder that hero points will not always be there to save you.

#### Born Expert
You can expend a hero point before or after rolling a skill check, changing the roll to a natural 20. Hero points can't be used to alter the result of skill checks using Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.

Hero points are meant as a burst of energy or force, they do not suddenly make someone more charismatic, or grant them knowledge of Dalarans vast library.

## New Backgrounds
Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your warrior might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your mage could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character's identity. The most important question to ask about your background is *what changed?* Why did you stop doing whatever your back-ground describes and start adventuring? Where did you <br>get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

The backgrounds in this chapter are meant as additions to the factions presented in the Player's Handbook, not as replacements for them.

#### Proficiencies
Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills. Skills are described in chapter 6 of the Player's Handbook.

In addition, most backgrounds give a character profi-ciency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook.

If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different profi-ciency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

#### Languages
Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See "Languages" earlier in this chapter.

#### Equipment
Each background provides a package of starting equip-ment. if you use the optional rule from chapter 4 to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.

#### Suggested Characteristics
A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the sugges-tions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.

#### Customizing a Background
You might want to tweak some of the features of a back-ground so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. 

You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in chapter 4. (If you spend coin, you can't also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can't find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your DM to create one.

### Double Agent
You are an informant for an opposing faction or organi-zation, secretly providing them with false information on behalf of another organization in which your loyalty lies. You may be an informant for the Scarlet Crusade, providing them with false intel on behalf of the forsakens. Perhaps you are a member of the Bilgewater Cartel, providing the goblin trade partners with false information to give the cartel the richest scores whilst staying out of their reach.

Discuss with your DM the factions/organizations you are working with and against.

<br> **Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Insight
<br> **Tool Proficiencies:** Forgery kit
<br> **Languages:** One of your choice from the opposite faction
<br> **Equipment:** Forgery kit, dagger, two pieces of chalk, 4 sheets of parchment, one bottle of ink, one quill, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Two Sides of One Coin
You have contacts within both organizations that you provide information to and/or for. Official organizations will often allow you to commit minor crimes without fear of punishment, or run a business without paying all the taxes or fees typically required. Additionally, you can gain an audience with functionaries from both organizations.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Having to work for two sides, hearing each sides story and delivering crucial information false or not. This is not a life for all, often shaping carries to leave personal connections behind, distance themselves from 'close' allies.

### Faction Fostered
You were abandoned at birth and found by members of the opposing faction, taken in by a family and raised as a member of their faction. Having had a harsh childhood of being shunned upon by members of the faction, never fully being accepted but merely tolerated in their presence.

You might be a tauren born in the eastern kingdoms, and abandoned by your parents, to be found by human farmers that took you in, nurtured you and raised you as their own, or you may be a human of Theramore, who ran away from your home, to be taken in by orcs and raised as a member of the horde within Orgrimmar, taught how to fight and learn the language of orcs.

Discuss with your DM the details of the faction and race who raised you, as not all races of Azeroth have an equal relationship towards other races.

<br> **Skill Proficiencies:** History, Perception
<br> **Languages:** Two of your choice from the faction you were raised ins faction languages.
<br> **Equipment:** A set of common clothes, hooded cloak, a trinket of your faction, book, one bottle of ink, one quill, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp

#### Feature: A False Allegiance
Your race and appearance makes you able to enter and go undisturbed through villages and cities of both factions, eye may wander upon you as you walk, but none will stop and ask questions, or raise arms against you.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Having lived a life amongst races of the opposite faction, getting to know and love their customs often make faction fostered social skills within their born faction limited. They are nonetheless social individuals, many of which greatly appreciate the races they now have grown up with, and stand by their side against their own kin.

### Kirin Tor Apprentice
You have been accepted into the Kirin Tor, Dalaran's elite cadre of the most powerful wizards on Azeroth. You have spent time within their school, earning yourself a magi mentor to oversee your studies and guide your learning.

You've learnt the basics of the schools of magic, and the ley lines of arcane magic that runs beneath the surface of Azeroth. You've spent enough time within Kirin Tors libraries, learning what knowledge interested you, and have been sent out onto Azeroth by your mentor to seek know-ledge elsewhere, and to gain experience.

<br> **Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, History
<br> **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools
<br> **Languages:** One of your choice
<br> **Equipment:** A bottle of high quality ink, a quill, chalk, a scroll case with 5 pieces of parchment, robes, a candle, tinder box, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp

#### Feature: A Prominent Mentor
You know at least one prominent mage within the Kirin Tor that you can call upon for answers and information. You've learnt a simple but limited spell that makes you able to contact them as long as you are on the same plane of existence. The spell is limited to a 100 word message, and a 100 word reply from the mentor. Once you've contacted your mentor, you cannot contact him again for a week, unless you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher. 

At the DMs discretion, the mentors information may be false, missing vital details, or they may not respond within a timely fashion.

Discuss the details of the mages you know within the Kirin Tor with your DM.

#### Suggested Characteristics
An apprentice of the Kirin Tor is often eager to learn what lies around Azeroth, wishing to learn any knowledge given to them. These apprentices vary drastically in personality, but they all have one thing in common, a deep lying wish for knowledge and understanding of the magic of the world.

# Chapter 4: New Equipment
The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers and sellers of many sorts:
dwarf smiths and elf woodcarvers, troll charms, goblin relics, and gnome jewelers, not to mention humans of every shape, size, and color drawn from a spectrum of nations and cultures. In the largest cities, almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets, practical swords, and beautiful elven bows.

For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a dungeon or the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the threats that Azeroth presents.

## Starting Equipment
When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of your class and your chosen background. Alternatively, you can start with a number of gold pieces based on your class and spend them on items from the lists in this chapter. See the Starting Wealth by Class table to determine how much gold you have to spend.

You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods that the character purchased during his or her upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon. armor, and a backpack as part of military service. You might even have stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, passed down from generation to generation until your character finally took up the mantle and followed in an ancestor's adventurous footsteps.

##### Starting Wealth by Class
|&nbsp;| Class  | Funds |&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|
|:-|:-----|------------:|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|| Druid  | 2d4 x 10 gp |||||||
|| Hunter | 5d4 x 10 gp |||||||
|| Mage   | 4d4 x 10 gp |||||||
|| Monk   | 5d4 gp      |||||||
|| Paladin| 5d4 x 10 gp |||||||
|| Priest | 4d4 x 10 gp |||||||
|| Rogue  | 4d4 x 10 gp |||||||
|| Shaman | 5d4 x 10 gp |||||||
|| Warlock| 4d4 x 10 gp |||||||
|| Warrior| 5d4 x 10 gp |||||||

## Wealth
Wealth varies drastically on Azeroth according to region. Coins, gems, trade goods, art object, animals, and property can reflect your character's financial well-being. Members of the peasantry trade in good, bartering for what they need to scrape what gold necessary to pay of their taxes.

Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such as the rights to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold bars, measuring gold by the pound rather than by the coin. 

Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering professional services for hire commonly deal in coins.

### Coinage
Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).

With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.

One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars.

In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces. 

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

##### Standard Exchange Rates
|&nbsp; Coin          | cp   | sp   | ep   | gp    | pp &nbsp;|
|:--------------------|-----:|-----:|-----:|------:|---------:|
|&nbsp; Copper (cp)   | 1    | 1/10 | 1/50 | 1/100 | 1/1000   |
|&nbsp; Silver (sp)   | 10   | 1    | 1/5  | 1/10  | 1/100    |
|&nbsp; Silver (sp)   | 50   | 5    | 1    | 1/2   | 1/20     |
|&nbsp; Gold (gp)     | 100  | 10   | 2    | 1     | 1/10     |
|&nbsp; Platinum (pp) | 1000 | 100  | 20   | 10    | 1        |

## Shields
The Shield table shows the cost, weight, and other proper-ties of the common types of shields worn on Azeroth.

***Shield Proficiency.*** Anyone can strap a shield to their arm. Only those proficient in the shield's use know how to wield it effectively, however. If you wield a shield that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.

#### Special Shields
Shields with special rules are described here.

***Buckler.*** A buckler is strapped to your forearm, allowing you to hold an item in its hand. If you use the shielded hand as part of an action or bonus action, you loose its increase to your Armor Class until the start of your next turn.

***Tower Shield.*** You use your Strength modifier, instead of your Dexterity for determining your Armor Class while you have this shield donned.

<div style='margin-top:100px;'></div>

## Racial Weapons
Your race may grant proficiency in special weapons that are crafted and used by your race exclusively. The night elves with their circular moon swords and glaives, taurens with their heavy blunt totems, capable of crushing most men, and the blood elves with their double ended warblades.

### Racial Weapon Proficiency
Your race, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain racial weapons. These weapons are exotic, and can't be wielded proficiently with simple and martial proficiency.

Proficiency with a racial weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

#### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described here.

***Sin'dorei Warblade.*** Immediately after attacking an enemy with this blade, you may make an additional attack with its second blade using your bonus action.

## Firearms
For tinkers the invention of the crossbow was not enough. They strived to further improve the ability to shoot from a distance without the aid of magic. With the invention of black powder, the dwarves of Ironforge were quick to act in experimenting with its uses, crafting the first firearms from which the weapon has evolved around.

### Firearm Proficiency
Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with firearms. The two categories are **flintlock** and **caplock**.

If you make an attack roll with a firearm without being proficient, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll, and you increase the firearms misfire score by 1. 

***Flintlock.*** A common trigger, requiring black powder to be poured into the barrel following a bullet in order to be fired. Flintlock weapons are unable to be shot in heavy rain, or while submerged in water.

***Caplock.*** A rare trigger, requiring special bullets with a black powder compartment built into them to be operated. Caplock weapons can be shot even in heavy rain, or whilst submerged in water.

<div style='margin-top:100px;'></div>

#### Firearm Properties
Firearms have special properties related to their use that are unique to them, as shown in the Weapons table.

***Misfire.*** Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon's Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Intelligence or Tinker's Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm.

***Reload.*** A limited number of shots can be made with a firearm. You must then reload it using an action or bonus action (Your choice).

#### Ammunition
Firearms require ammunition to make an attack. Flint and caplock firearms use the same ammunition. Both ammuni-tions are generally sold in batches at the prices list below. Blunderbuss and Scatterguns use special ammunition that has its own price.

#### Crafting
If materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition your-self using Tinker's Tools at half the cost in the table below. 

Requiring a successful DC 12 Tinker's Tools check to be done over the course of a short rest, crafting 1 batch of ammunition for the chosen weapon type.

# Chapter 5: Customization Options
The combination of ability scores, race, class, and background defines your character's capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and race, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who want to go a step further.

This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for cus-tomizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multi-classing lets you combine classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels.

## Multiclassing
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options. 

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in mage and two in warrior, you're a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely. never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class.

### Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a warrior who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength or Dexterity and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class. having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

##### Multiclassing Prerequisites
|&nbsp; Class   | Ability Score Minimum       |
|:--------------|:----------------------------|
|&nbsp; Druid   | Wisdom 13                   |
|&nbsp; Hunter  | Dexterity or Strength 13    |
|&nbsp; Mage    | Intelligence 13             |
|&nbsp; Monk    | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13  |
|&nbsp; Paladin | Strength 13 and Charisma 13 |
|&nbsp; Priest  | Wisdom 13                   |
|&nbsp; Rogue   | Dexterity 13                |
|&nbsp; Shaman  | Wisdom 13                   |
|&nbsp; Warlock | Intelligence 13             |
|&nbsp; Warrior | Strength or Dexterity 13    |
|&nbsp; Death Knight | Strength 13 and Charisma 13 |
|&nbsp; Demon Hunter | Dexterity 13 and Intelligence 13 |

### Experience Points
The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1 of the Player's Handbook, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a priest 6/warrior 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a warrior or your seventh level as a priest.

### Hit Points and Hit Dice
You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. if the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the warrior and the paladin have a d10. so if you area paladin 5/warrior 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/priest 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d6 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus
Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1 of the Player's Handbook, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a warrior 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies
When you gain a level in a class other than your first, you gain only some of that class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

##### Multiclassing Proficiencies

### Class Features
When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features, however, have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting,

#### Channel Divinity / Necromancy
If you already have the Channel Divinity or Necromancy feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a priest 6 / paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the priest class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

#### Extra Attack
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the warrior's version of Extra Attack or a shaman's wind shield does).

#### Unarmored Defense
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

#### Spellcasting
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

***Spells Known and Prepared.*** You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a shaman 3 / pries 4, for example, you know four shaman cantrips, and four 1st-level shaman spells based on your levels in the shaman class. As 4th-level priest, you know four priest cantrips. If your wisdom is 16, you can prepare six priest spells of 1st and 2nd-level.

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.

***Spell Slots.*** You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the death knight, druid, mage, priest, and warlock classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and shaman classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Spellcaster table found later in this chapter.

If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your Lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like *burning hands*, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned shaman 3 / priest 4, you count as a 7th-level character when—


\columnbreak

determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level shaman spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know.

***Shadow Magic.*** If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Shadow Magic class feature, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Shadow Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast spells you know from classes with the Shadow Magic class feature.

#### Shadow Magic
You determine your available spell slots and the level of those spell slots by adding together all your levels in the death knight, and warlock class. Use this total to determine your spell slots and spell level by consulting the Shadow Magic table found later in this chapter.

##### Multiclassing Shadow Magic:
|&nbsp; Lvl. |&nbsp;|Spell Slots|&nbsp;| Spell Level|
|:----:|:-|:-:|:-|:-:|
| 1st  || 1 || 1st |
| 2nd  || 2 || 1st |

## New Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, exper-ience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow you can't benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.

The feats presented in this book are meant as additions to those presented in the 5th edition Player's Handbook.

## Racial Feats
Races on Azeroth are not equal in strength, the average tauren is considerably stronger than the average human. This section introduces a collection of special feats that allow you to empower your character's race further. These feats are each associated with a race from earlier in this book, and summarized in the Racial Feats table. A racial feat represents either a deepening connection to your race's culture or a physical transformation that brings you closer to an aspect of your
race's lineage.

The cause of a particular transformation is up to you and your DM. A transformational feat can symbolize a latent quality that has emerged as you age, or a transformation might be the result of an event in the campaign, such as exposure to powerful magic or visiting a place of ancient significance to your race. 

##### Racial Feats
|&nbsp; Race                    | Feat                     |

The target's game statistics including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. 

If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

## Shaman Spirit Animal
Upon reaching 5th level as a shaman, you gain the favor of a spirit animal, an animal shape you are able to shapeshift into at will through the aid of the spirits of the wild. Whilst druids are able to take the complete shape of certain animals, shifting into various beasts, the strain upon a shamans shapeshift lies much deeper within. As a result, the animal shape taken appears as an incorporeal transparent shape in the material world, often with ghostly visage around it.

Shamans connection the spirits is limited, as is their spirit animal, making it unable to be used for fighting, if you make an attack or hostile action against a creature, the connection is immediately severed, returning you to your own body. 

Most shamans choose one spirit animal, and sticks with that spirit animal throughout their life. Orcs and trolls commonly go for a dire wolf, a shape well known to both, known for its ferocity and speed. Whilst a dwarf might choose a bear, a steadfast companion by many of the dwarven kin. Think about your spirit animal, why and if it fits your character, a shamans spirit animal is in many ways an extension of who they are, reflecting their personality. The only limitation given upon a spirit animal is that it cannot have a swim, or fly speed. 

A shamans shape is limited, as so it has a specific set of statistics no matter which animal shape is chosen as showed below. Talk with your DM about altering the statistics to better suit your chosen animal.

# Appendix B: Special Tasks
Prestige classes require special tasks to be completed before a character can enter that class, this Appendix tries to explain the basics of what must be done for someone to become a Death Knight, or Demon Hunter. Bare in mind the information here is a mixture of canon and non-canon lore, and may not reflect how your DM goes about these tasks. 

## Death Knight Task
**Complete a Special Task.** To become a death knight you must find the dark simulacrum and perform the ritual presented in it. At which point you will be reawaken as a weak death knight.

#### Finding the Dark Simulacrum
Finding the dark simulacrum may prove an easy task, or an exceptionally hard one. It all depends on the DM and when they decide to make the item available for you. You might have it from level 1, an heirloom passed down through generations in your family, you may stumble upon it in a warlocks lair, or you might find it in a book store tucked away and gathering dust.

The exact location of the book is a mystery to all but the DM, giving them the ability to implement it in whichever way they see fit.

#### Using the Book
There is not stages to becoming a death knight as there are with demon hunters, the transformation is much quicker and without as much preparation required. Any character able to read Common is able to read the interior of the book, and gain its benefits if they study it for 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer. This is true even if you are not a spellcaster and don't have any innate magic, you will still be granted the secrets of the book.

#### Place of Power
A place of power can be many things, there are not set list of specifics an area has to have to be a place a power, it could easily be a witches workshop, a necromancers demonic alter, or a mages study. These are simple places of power able to be found across Azeroth, but they might not always be available to the player, locked away or hidden. A place of power can be more than a spellcasters workshop. For a night elf it might be the world trees, for an orc the clans communion with the elements, for a human it might be a church to the Holy Light.

A place of power can be more than something magically imbued, or something that has traces of past magic. It can be something icnoic, or with an emotional connection to a race or the player.

#### A Guardian Angel
To complete the ritual the player must call forth a val'kyr from the realm of shadows, these ascended vrykuls are remarkable and extraordinarily powerful creatures, most of whom serve either the titan keeper Odyn or the banshee queen Sylvanas. The called val'kul serves no master, and exists only through the book, should it be destroyed she is bound to the shadow realm for eternity.

The val'kyr's alignment is neutral, and it uses the **deva** statblock, attacking only in self defense.

\columnbreak

#### Dark Simulacrum
*Wondrous item, rare*
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

This dark brown tome clad with a silver edge and a runic engraving on its front cover. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, you learn the spells *Runeblade*, *Altar of Power*, and *Summon Val'kyr* as well as how to per-form a ritual with them to gain death knights power, these spells do not take up spell slots but can only be cast once per long rest each. Once the ritual has been done, you lose all memories of these spells. Then the tome loses its magic, but regains it in a year.

#### Altar of Power
*Simulacrum necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour
___
You touch a place of power, filling it with necrotic energy. Until the spells ends, the place of power is desecrated and able to function as an alter able to be used in the sacrificial ritual to gain the powers of the death knights.

#### Runeblade
*Simulacrum enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 hours
___
You touch a nonmagical weapon, imbuing it with runes that runs along its edge. Until the spell ends, that weapon be-comes a magical weapon able to be used in the sacrificial ritual to gain the powers of the death knights.

#### Summon Val'kyr
*Simulacrum conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour
___
You call forth a val'kyr from the shadow realm in an un-occupied space that you can see within range. The val'kyr stays for 1 hour before disappearing again. The summoned val'kyr is neutral to you and your companions, and does not obey any commands you might give it. But is able to sense the presence of a magically imbued runeblade, and a desecrated altar of power.

If the val'kyr is witness to player sacrificing themselves on an altar of power using the runeblade, the val'kyr uses 10 minutes to cast a unique version of *resurrection*, bring-ing the player back and granting them a level in the death knight class. The player gains none of the penalties nor-mally granted by players brought back using *resurrection.*

If the val'kyr resurrects a player, the val'kyr and dark simulacrum vanishes, and anyone who knew how to cast the spells granted by the dark simulacrum loses all memory of how the spells are performed.

Once spell ends, the val'kyr vanishes leaving behind the dark simulacrum and the memories of how to cast the spells within.

## Demon Hunter Task
**Complete a Special Task.** You must find one or more demon hunters willing to lead you through the array of complex rituals required to become a demon hunter.

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

#### Finding a Demon Hunter
Finding a demon hunter willing to lead the player through the various rituals might prove difficult, demon hunters are sparse, and never stay in an area for long before moving on to a new location. Once a demon hunter is found, it may prove difficult to convince them to aid you. They know what the rituals entails, how it affects those who attempt them, how few survive it, and the various sacrifices the player has to make to finish it.

Not just any demon hunter is capable of taking a new initiates through the rituals, and it is not uncommon for multiple demon hunters to aid in the process. In order to undergo the ritual, you need demon hunters with a com-bined level of 20 between them to be able to infuse the player properly with fel magic.

#### Stage 1: Demon Bonding
To begin the process of becoming a demon hunter, the player has to hunt and capture a sentient demon. A demon with an Intelligence above 10, as the ceremony below requires an intelligent being for bonding to work. Captur-ing a demon is a simple task, that could quickly prove difficult for low level parties.

Once a demon has been captured, it has to be brought to the willing demon hunters that is administering the ritual. It is uncommon for the demon hunter to accompany the character in hunting and capturing the demon, as most see it as a test of strength and will. If the player can't complete this task, they are considered unworthy of being given the powers of their kin.

Once ready, the demon hunters present begin to channel fel into the ground around the demon, to capture its soul once slain. Whilst they are channeling, the player is forced to sacrifice the demon, slaying it in whichever way they see fit. After the demon has been killed, the player is given a ritualistic knife, and tasked with carving out the heart of the demon, and collecting a portion of its blood in a flask.

The player is required to eat its heart, and drink its blood while within the fel channeled area, at the end of which the demons spirit will attempt to flee and be captured by the fel magic. The spirit is then placed within the player by the aid of magic, and forever bonded with the player. Even though the spirit is bonded with the player, the player is not yet in control of it, and the demon will try to take control.

#### Stage 2: Visions of Fire
The bond between the player and demon is untamed, the demon will continue to try and take control of the player until it is suppressed.

As the demon bonds with the player, the player is imme-diately shown countless visions in quick flashes, visions of the Burning Legion's crusade, the countless planets they have fought and destroyed across the universe. These visions bring horrors to even the strongest players, many entering a coma or immediately dying as the demon struggles to overthrow the players control.

Shortly after the demon has been bound to the player, after enough time has passed for the player to see the horrors of the Burning Legion, and gained a hatred for what atrocities they have done. 

If the player is still alive, they are once more give the ritualistic knife in their hands, and tasked to carve out their eye sockets. If the player is unwilling or if they are uncon-scious, the demon hunter forcefully removes their eyes. During which the visions that flashed before the player will vanish, sending the player into a coma. Most new demon hunters stay in the coma for a few days, giving the other demon hunters time to finish the rituals. Some new initiates stay in the coma for longer, and about half never wake as the demon took over their mind, devouring their soul and killing the newly made demon hunter.

#### Stage 3: Taming the Demon
Whilst the player is in a coma, the demon hunters continue the rituals on their body to aid in the entrapment and control of their inner demon. During this time the players empty sockets are covered with a piece of thick cloth, the cloth is more symbolic than practical, and helps the demon hunter in social encounters, as their eyes can be frighte-ning at first glance. While the demon hunter is in a coma, flickering green dots begin to appear behind the cloth if the demon hunter is alive.

While the demon hunter is in a coma, their body is infused with deadly amounts of fel magic to aid in controll-ing the demon within, the fel quickly becomes apparent on the hunters body as the fel mutates their body, giving them demonic features such as scales, horns, or claws. The fel also fuses to their body in the form of rough hard lined tattoos, these tattoos are fused with fel magic, functioning as a prison for the demon within.

These rituals are tiresome, and take place over multiple hours, slowly shaping the demon hunter, granting them their demonic appearances and slaving the demon within to the hunters will. Once the rituals are done, the hunters eyes will begin to flicker as green embers behind the cloth, a trait that will continue till the demon hunters death.

#### Stage 4: Reawakening
If the player survives, they will eventually be pulled out of their coma, and wake up to find their body changed. The tattoos placed upon their body will begin to shine with the faintest of light in the color of their paint. The embers in the sockets will flicker behind their cloth cover, and show as green flames bursting out if the cloth is removed. The flames are warm but harmless.

The majority of demon hunter takes years to master their new found powers, taking time to adjust to their new way of life, and the constant influence of the demon within them. While the demon is trapped and unable to take control, its presence will forever be there and be felt by the hunter, always attempting to entice the hunter to join the Burning Legion, an offer many hunters have taken up, only to meet a fate worse than theirs.

> This is but my interpretation of how a player would become a demon hunter, and are meant more as a guideline than rules. You can change them, remove or add more as you please.

> You may have realized mentions that a large amount of Demon Hunter dies, but never any saving throws that the player had to go through. Although the player should be aware that few survive these rituals, this is not meant as a potential death for that player.

I've had a love for the Warcraft franchise since I was young, and have followed it closely for years at this point. Wasn't long after I got into D&D that I thought to myself that playing D&D in the Warcraft universe would be a blast.

This has been a blast to make, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I hope it brings enjoyment to many D&D tables across the world. Best of luck to all the parties of human and orc, try not to chop each other too much up ;)

Did you know this was all made using GmBinder? I can't stretch enough how fantastic a tool it is for creating homebrew material for 5th edition D&D.
